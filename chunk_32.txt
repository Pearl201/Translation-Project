en_1. for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.
bal_1.
en_2. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
bal_2.
en_3. After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.
bal_3.
en_4. He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.
bal_4.
en_5. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
bal_5.
en_6. We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.
bal_6.
en_7. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.
bal_7.
en_8. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.
bal_8.
en_9. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
bal_9.
en_10. We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.
bal_10.
en_11. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.
bal_11.
en_12. From thence we proceeded to Oxford.
bal_12.
en_13. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.
bal_13.
en_14. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.
bal_14.
en_15. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.
bal_15.
en_16. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.
bal_16.
en_17. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.
bal_17.
en_18. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
bal_18.
en_19. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.
bal_19.
en_20. I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.
bal_20.
en_21. I was formed for peaceful happiness.
bal_21.
en_22. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits.
bal_22.
en_23. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
bal_23.
en_24. We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.
bal_24.
en_25. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.
bal_25.
en_26. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.
bal_26.
en_27. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.
bal_27.
en_28. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.
bal_28.
en_29. We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.
bal_29.
en_30. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.
bal_30.
en_31. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.
bal_31.
en_32. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
bal_32.
en_33. From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.
bal_33.
en_34. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.
bal_34.
en_35. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.
bal_35.
en_36. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.
bal_36.
en_37. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.
bal_37.
en_38. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”
bal_38.
en_39. But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.
bal_39.
en_40. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
bal_40.
en_41. We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.
bal_41.
en_42. For my own part I was not sorry.
bal_42.
en_43. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment.
bal_43.
en_44. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.
bal_44.
en_45. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.
bal_45.
en_46. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.
bal_46.
en_47. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
bal_47.
en_48. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.
bal_48.
en_49. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.
bal_49.
en_50. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
bal_50.
en_51. I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.
bal_51.
en_52. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
bal_52.
en_53. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s
bal_53.
en_54. Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.
bal_54.
en_55. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
bal_55.
en_56. We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
bal_56.
en_57. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.
bal_57.
en_58. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.
bal_58.
en_59. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.”
bal_59.
en_60. Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.
bal_60.
en_61. He entreated me to write often.
bal_61.
en_62. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.”
bal_62.
en_63. Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.
bal_63.
en_64. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.
bal_64.
en_65. With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.
bal_65.
en_66. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.
bal_66.
en_67. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.
bal_67.
en_68. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
bal_68.
en_69. On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.
bal_69.
en_70. This I hired.
bal_70.
en_71. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.
bal_71.
en_72. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.
bal_72.
en_73. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.
bal_73.
en_74. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.
bal_74.
en_75. In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.
bal_75.
en_76. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.
bal_76.
en_77. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.
bal_77.
en_78. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.
bal_78.
en_79. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
bal_79.
en_80. In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.
bal_80.
en_81. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.
bal_81.
en_82. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.
bal_82.
en_83. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.
bal_83.
en_84. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
bal_84.
en_85. Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.
bal_85.
en_86. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.
bal_86.
en_87. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.
bal_87.
en_88. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
bal_88.
en_89. In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.
bal_89.
en_90. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.
bal_90.
en_91. Chapter 20 I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it.
bal_91.
en_92. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.
bal_92.
en_93. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse.
bal_93.
en_94. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.
bal_94.
en_95. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.
bal_95.
en_96. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?
bal_96.
en_97. She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.
bal_97.
en_98. Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror.
bal_98.
en_99. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?
bal_99.
en_100. I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
bal_100.
en_101. I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.
bal_101.
en_102. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.
bal_102.
en_103. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.
bal_103.
en_104. As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.
bal_104.
en_105. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.
bal_105.
en_106. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
bal_106.
en_107. I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.
bal_107.
en_108. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.
bal_108.
en_109. Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.
bal_109.
en_110. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.
bal_110.
en_111. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.
bal_111.
en_112. In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.
bal_112.
en_113. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
bal_113.
en_114. Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.
bal_114.
en_115. Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
bal_115.
en_116. Do you dare to break your promise?
bal_116.
en_117. I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.
bal_117.
en_118. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.
bal_118.
en_119. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”
bal_119.
en_120. “Begone!
bal_120.
en_121. I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”
bal_121.
en_122. “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension.
bal_122.
en_123. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.
bal_123.
en_124. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!”
bal_124.
en_125. “The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.
bal_125.
en_126. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.
bal_126.
en_127. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?
bal_127.
en_128. Begone!
bal_128.
en_129. I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.”
bal_129.
en_130. The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.
bal_130.
en_131. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?
bal_131.
en_132. I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
bal_132.
en_133. Man!
bal_133.
en_134. You may hate, but beware!
bal_134.
en_135. Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever.
bal_135.
en_136. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
bal_136.
en_137. You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!
bal_137.
en_138. I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.
bal_138.
en_139. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.
bal_139.
en_140. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.
bal_140.
en_141. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.”
bal_141.
en_142. “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
bal_142.
en_143. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.
bal_143.
en_144. Leave me; I am inexorable.”
bal_144.
en_145. “It is well.
bal_145.
en_146. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”
bal_146.
en_147. I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain!
bal_147.
en_148. Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”
bal_148.
en_149. I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation.
bal_149.
en_150. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.
bal_150.
en_151. All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.
bal_151.
en_152. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.
bal_152.
en_153. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.
bal_153.
en_154. Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?
bal_154.
en_155. But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.
bal_155.
en_156. I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
bal_156.
en_157. And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on your wedding-night._”
bal_157.
en_158. That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.
bal_158.
en_159. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.
bal_159.
en_160. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.
bal_160.
en_161. The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair.
bal_161.
en_162. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.
bal_162.
en_163. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.
bal_163.
en_164. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created.
bal_164.
en_165. I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.
bal_165.
en_166. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep.
bal_166.
en_167. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.
bal_167.
en_168. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.
bal_168.
en_169. The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.
bal_169.
en_170. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.
bal_170.
en_171. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.
bal_171.
en_172. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.
bal_172.
en_173. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
bal_173.
en_174. Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.
bal_174.
en_175. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.
bal_175.
en_176. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.
bal_176.
en_177. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.
bal_177.
en_178. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.
bal_178.
en_179. Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.
bal_179.
en_180. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.
bal_180.
en_181. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.
bal_181.
en_182. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.
bal_182.
en_183. Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
bal_183.
en_184. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.
bal_184.
en_185. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.
bal_185.
en_186. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.
bal_186.
en_187. The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.
bal_187.
en_188. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.
bal_188.
en_189. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.
bal_189.
en_190. I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.
bal_190.
en_191. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.
bal_191.
en_192. I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.
bal_192.
en_193. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.
bal_193.
en_194. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.
bal_194.
en_195. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.
bal_195.
en_196. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.
bal_196.
en_197. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.
bal_197.
en_198. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.
bal_198.
en_199. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.
bal_199.
en_200. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!”
bal_200.
en_201. I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.
bal_201.
en_202. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
bal_202.
en_203. Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.
bal_203.
en_204. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.
bal_204.
en_205. Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
bal_205.
en_206. How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!
bal_206.
en_207. I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.
bal_207.
en_208. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.
bal_208.
en_209. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.
bal_209.
en_210. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.
bal_210.
en_211. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.
bal_211.
en_212. Fortunately I had money with me.
bal_212.
en_213. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.
bal_213.
en_214. As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.
bal_214.
en_215. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.
bal_215.
en_216. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.
bal_216.
en_217. “My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?”
bal_217.
en_218. “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.
bal_218.
en_219. “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”
bal_219.
en_220. I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.
bal_220.
en_221. “Why do you answer me so roughly?”
bal_221.
en_222. I replied.
bal_222.
en_223. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.”
bal_223.
en_224. “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”
bal_224.
en_225. While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.
bal_225.
en_226. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.
bal_226.
en_227. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.
bal_227.
en_228. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”
bal_228.
en_229. “Who is Mr. Kirwin?
bal_229.
en_230. Why am I to give an account of myself?
bal_230.
en_231. Is not this a free country?”
bal_231.
en_232. “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.
bal_232.
en_233. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”
bal_233.
en_234. This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.
bal_234.
en_235. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.
bal_235.
en_236. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.
bal_236.
en_237. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.
bal_237.
en_238. I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.
bal_238.
en_239. Chapter 21 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.
bal_239.
en_240. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
bal_240.

en_1. a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there.
bal_1.
en_2. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner.
bal_2.
en_3. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed.
bal_3.
en_4. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.
bal_4.
en_5. When coming home--it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out.
bal_5.
en_6. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it.
bal_6.
en_7. She did not notice or make any movement whatever.
bal_7.
en_8. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window.
bal_8.
en_9. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut.
bal_9.
en_10. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird.
bal_10.
en_11. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.
bal_11.
en_12. I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.
bal_12.
en_13. She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.
bal_13.
en_14. I fear she is fretting about something.
bal_14.
en_15. I wish I could find out what it is.
bal_15.

bal_17.
en_18. Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called.
bal_18.
en_19. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
bal_19.
en_20. Arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.
bal_20.
en_21. Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.
bal_21.
en_22. Later on in the day she told me the cause.
bal_22.
en_23. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her.
bal_23.
en_24. Poor dear, sweet lady!
bal_24.
en_25. She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant.
bal_25.
en_26. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening.
bal_26.
en_27. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her.
bal_27.
en_28. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.

en_33. I have not had the heart to write.
bal_33.
en_34. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
bal_34.
en_35. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother’s hours are numbering to a close.
bal_35.
en_36. I do not understand Lucy’s fading away as she is doing.
bal_36.
en_37. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping as if for air.
bal_37.
en_38. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window.
bal_38.
en_39. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint.
bal_39.
en_40. When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath.
bal_40.
en_41. When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away.
bal_41.
en_42. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin.
bal_42.
en_43. I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
bal_43.
en_44. They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white.
bal_44.
en_45. They are like little white dots with red centres.
bal_45.
en_46. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

bal_72.
en_73. _18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard.
bal_73.
en_74. Lucy is ever so much better.
bal_74.
en_75. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once.
bal_75.
en_76. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking.
bal_76.
en_77. If she were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not.
bal_77.
en_78. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness.
bal_78.
en_79. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep.
bal_79.
en_80. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:-- “My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then!
bal_80.
en_81. I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up Geordie.”
bal_81.
en_82. As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night.
bal_82.
en_83. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does.
bal_83.
en_84. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:-- “I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real.
bal_84.
en_85. I only wanted to be here in this spot--I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something--I don’t know what.
bal_85.
en_86. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge.
bal_86.
en_87. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps.
bal_87.
en_88. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
bal_88.
en_89. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.
bal_89.
en_90. I saw you do it before I felt you.”
bal_90.
en_91. Then she began to laugh.
bal_91.
en_92. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly.
bal_92.
en_93. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again.
bal_93.
en_94. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy.
bal_94.
en_95. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.

en_107. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there.

bal_108.

bal_109.

en_111. I am only taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that ...

bal_122.
en_123. He will require some few weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return.
bal_123.
en_124. He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall not be wanting for help.

bal_127.
en_128. All blessings to you both!
bal_128.
en_129. He has had some fearful shock--so says our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of what.
bal_129.
en_130. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away.

en_132. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home.

en_140. _Dr. Seward’s Diary.
bal_140.
en_141. _ _19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night.
bal_141.
en_142. About eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting.
bal_142.
en_143. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk.
bal_143.
en_144. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty.
bal_144.
en_145. Would not condescend to talk with him at all.
bal_145.
en_146. All he would say was:--
bal_146.
en_147. “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at hand.”
bal_147.
en_148. The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him.
bal_148.
en_149. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.
bal_149.
en_150. The combination is a dreadful one.
bal_150.
en_151. At nine o’clock I visited him myself.
bal_151.
en_152. His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing.
bal_152.
en_153. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God.
bal_153.
en_154. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being.
bal_154.
en_155. How these madmen give themselves away!
bal_155.
en_156. The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.
bal_156.
en_157. Oh, if men only knew!
bal_157.
en_158. For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree.
bal_158.
en_159. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same.
bal_159.
en_160. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well.
bal_160.
en_161. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes.
bal_161.
en_162. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention.
bal_162.
en_163. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:-- “Bother them all!
bal_163.
en_164. I don’t care a pin about them.”
bal_164.
en_165. “What?” I said.
bal_165.
en_166. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about spiders?”
bal_166.
en_167. (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures.)
bal_167.
en_168. To this he answered enigmatically:-- “The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.”
bal_168.
en_169. He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.
bal_169.
en_170. I am weary to-night and low in spirits.
bal_170.
en_171. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been.
bal_171.
en_172. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O!
bal_172.
en_173. I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit.
bal_173.
en_174. No, I shall take none to-night!
bal_174.
en_175. I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two.
bal_175.
en_176. If need be, to-night shall be sleepless....

en_180. _Later._--Glad
bal_180.
en_181. I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it.
bal_181.
en_182. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped.
bal_182.
en_183. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about.
bal_183.
en_184. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.
bal_184.
en_185. The attendant was waiting for me.
bal_185.
en_186. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door.
bal_186.
en_187. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.
bal_187.
en_188. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me.
bal_188.
en_189. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
bal_189.
en_190. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door.
bal_190.
en_191. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through the window.
bal_191.
en_192. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt.
bal_192.
en_193. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.
bal_193.
en_194. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.
bal_194.
en_195. I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous.
bal_195.
en_196. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side.
bal_196.
en_197. I could see Renfield’s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him.
bal_197.
en_198. On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel.
bal_198.
en_199. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off.
bal_199.
en_200. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him!
bal_200.
en_201. After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.
bal_201.
en_202. I heard him say:-- “I am here to do Your bidding, Master.
bal_202.
en_203. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful.
bal_203.
en_204. I have worshipped You long and afar off.
bal_204.
en_205. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”
bal_205.
en_206. He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow.
bal_206.
en_207. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence.
bal_207.
en_208. His manias make a startling combination.
bal_208.
en_209. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
bal_209.
en_210. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man.
bal_210.
en_211. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I shall not again.
bal_211.
en_212. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time.
bal_212.
en_213. With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged.
bal_213.
en_214. He is safe now at any rate.
bal_214.
en_215. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded room.
bal_215.
en_216. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.
bal_216.
en_217. Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:-- “I shall be patient, Master.
bal_217.
en_218. It is coming--coming--coming!”
bal_218.
en_219. So I took the hint, and came too.
bal_219.
en_220. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.

bal_227.
en_228. I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking.
bal_228.
en_229. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished.
bal_229.
en_230. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past.
bal_230.

en_234. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust.
bal_234.
en_235. She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned.
bal_235.
en_236. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you.
bal_236.
en_237. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.’
bal_237.
en_238. I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.
bal_238.
en_239. The idea of _my_ being jealous about Jonathan!
bal_239.
en_240. And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a cause of trouble.
bal_240.
en_241. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps.
bal_241.
en_242. He is waking!...
bal_242.
en_243. “When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
bal_243.
en_244. I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
bal_244.
en_245. Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:-- “‘Wilhelmina’--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--‘you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment.
bal_245.
en_246. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman.
bal_246.
en_247. You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad.
bal_247.
en_248. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it.
bal_248.
en_249. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’
bal_249.
en_250. For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete.
bal_250.
en_251. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance?
bal_251.
en_252. Here is the book.
bal_252.
en_253. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’
bal_253.
en_254. He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him.
bal_254.
en_255. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....

bal_263.
en_264. I feel very solemn, but very, very happy.
bal_264.
en_265. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows.
bal_265.
en_266. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly and strongly.
bal_266.
en_267. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.
bal_267.
en_268. The dear sisters were so kind.
bal_268.
en_269. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me.
bal_269.
en_270. I must tell you of my wedding present.
bal_270.
en_271. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’--left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring.
bal_271.
en_272. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty.
bal_272.
en_273. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be.
bal_273.
en_274. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.
bal_274.
en_275. “Well, my dear, what could I say?
bal_275.
en_276. I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life.
bal_276.
en_277. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us....
bal_277.
en_278. “Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?
bal_278.
en_279. It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me.
bal_279.
en_280. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life.
bal_280.
en_281. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am.
bal_281.
en_282. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust.
bal_282.
en_283. I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be _always_ as happy as I am _now_.
bal_283.
en_284. Good-bye, my dear.
bal_284.
en_285. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again.
bal_285.
en_286. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking--I must attend to my husband!

en_293. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me.
bal_293.
en_294. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well.
bal_294.
en_295. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep.

en_299. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever.
bal_299.
en_300. He _tells_ me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn’t love me more than he did then.
bal_300.
en_301. But this is nonsense.

bal_308.
en_309. August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting.
bal_309.
en_310. He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
bal_310.
en_311. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent.
bal_311.
en_312. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.”
bal_312.
en_313. The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him.
bal_313.
en_314. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might almost say, “cringing”--softness.
bal_314.
en_315. I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved.
bal_315.
en_316. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest.
bal_316.
en_317. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:-- “They think I could hurt you!
bal_317.
en_318. Fancy _me_ hurting _you_!
bal_318.
en_319. The fools!”
bal_319.
en_320. It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought.
bal_320.
en_321. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him?
bal_321.
en_322. I must find out later on.
bal_322.
en_323. To-night he will not speak.
bal_323.
en_324. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him.
bal_324.
en_325. He will only say: “I don’t take any stock in cats.
bal_325.
en_326. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait.”
bal_326.
en_327. After a while I left him.
bal_327.
en_328. The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.

bal_333.
en_334. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
bal_334.
en_335. Happy thought!

en_336. We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones.
bal_336.
en_337. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it.

bal_343.
en_344. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.
bal_344.
en_345. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day.
bal_345.
en_346. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise.
bal_346.
en_347. The poor soul’s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it.
bal_347.
en_348. Hark!

en_357. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage.
bal_357.
en_358. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
bal_358.
en_359. Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old

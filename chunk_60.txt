en_1. no right to be; but this is no ordinary case.
bal_1.
en_2. You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t help feeling anxious about her all the same.
bal_2.
en_3. What is it that’s wrong with her?
bal_3.
en_4. The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have _another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
bal_4.
en_5. Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private.
bal_5.
en_6. But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part.
bal_6.
en_7. Is not that so?”
bal_7.
en_8. “That’s so,” I said, and he went on:-- “I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day.
bal_8.
en_9. Is not that so?”
bal_9.
en_10. “That’s so.”
bal_10.
en_11. “And I guess Art was in it too.
bal_11.
en_12. When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer.
bal_12.
en_13. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.
bal_13.
en_14. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay.
bal_14.
en_15. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?”
bal_15.
en_16. As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.
bal_16.
en_17. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.
bal_17.
en_18. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down.
bal_18.
en_19. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: “That’s so.”
bal_19.
en_20. “And how long has this been going on?”
bal_20.
en_21. “About ten days.”
bal_21.
en_22. “Ten days!
bal_22.
en_23. Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men.
bal_23.
en_24. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.”
bal_24.
en_25. Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it out?”
bal_25.
en_26. I shook my head.
bal_26.
en_27. “That,” I said, “is the crux.
bal_27.
en_28. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end.
bal_28.
en_29. I can’t even hazard a guess.
bal_29.
en_30. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.
bal_30.
en_31. But these shall not occur again.
bal_31.
en_32. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.”
bal_32.
en_33. Quincey held out his hand.
bal_33.
en_34. “Count me in,” he said.
bal_34.
en_35. “You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.”
bal_35.
en_36. When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read.
bal_36.
en_37. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.
bal_37.
en_38. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.
bal_38.
en_39. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.
bal_39.
en_40. We both understood what that meant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her.
bal_40.
en_41. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.
bal_41.
en_42. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her.
bal_42.
en_43. Towards dusk she fell into a doze.
bal_43.
en_44. Here a very odd thing occurred.
bal_44.
en_45. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two.
bal_45.
en_46. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her.
bal_46.
en_47. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.
bal_47.
en_48. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.

bal_51.
en_52. _19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.
bal_52.
en_53. The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended.
bal_53.
en_54. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.
bal_54.
en_55. When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy’s strength.
bal_55.
en_56. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.
bal_56.
en_57. At times she slept, and both Van Helsing
bal_57.
en_58. and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking.
bal_58.
en_59. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one.
bal_59.
en_60. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
bal_60.
en_61. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.
bal_61.
en_62. When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks.
bal_62.
en_63. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.
bal_63.
en_64. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened.
bal_64.
en_65. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived.
bal_65.
en_66. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.
bal_66.
en_67. It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her.
bal_67.
en_68. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy’s phonograph.
bal_68.
en_69. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest.
bal_69.
en_70. I fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great; the poor child cannot rally.
bal_70.
en_71. God help us all.

bal_73.
en_74. “_17 September._
bal_74.
en_75. “My dearest Lucy,-- “It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote.
bal_75.
en_76. You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news.
bal_76.
en_77. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins.
bal_77.
en_78. He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.
bal_78.
en_79. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:-- “‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both.
bal_79.
en_80. I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up.
bal_80.
en_81. Now I want you to make your home here with me.
bal_81.
en_82. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.’
bal_82.
en_83. I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands.
bal_83.
en_84. Our evening was a very, very happy one.
bal_84.
en_85. “So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks--and humans.
bal_85.
en_86. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping.
bal_86.
en_87. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.
bal_87.
en_88. “How is your dear mother getting on?
bal_88.
en_89. I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still.
bal_89.
en_90. He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity.
bal_90.
en_91. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.
bal_91.
en_92. And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours.
bal_92.
en_93. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding?
bal_93.
en_94. Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me.
bal_94.
en_95. Jonathan asks me to send his ‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead.
bal_95.
en_96. Good-bye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.

bal_99.
en_100. “My dear Sir,--
bal_100.
en_101. “In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge....
bal_101.
en_102. With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say.
bal_102.
en_103. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results.
bal_103.
en_104. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away.
bal_104.
en_105. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers.
bal_105.
en_106. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.
bal_106.
en_107. As he passed the window of Renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to.
bal_107.
en_108. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it.
bal_108.
en_109. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless yer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse.
bal_109.
en_110. I pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wild beast like that.’
bal_110.
en_111. Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man.
bal_111.
en_112. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.
bal_112.
en_113. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner.
bal_113.
en_114. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair.
bal_114.
en_115. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.
bal_115.
en_116. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue.
bal_116.
en_117. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief.
bal_117.
en_118. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes.
bal_118.
en_119. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise.
bal_119.
en_120. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground.
bal_120.
en_121. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then.
bal_121.
en_122. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip.
bal_122.
en_123. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens.
bal_123.
en_124. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men.
bal_124.
en_125. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them!
bal_125.
en_126. They shan’t rob me!
bal_126.
en_127. they shan’t murder me by inches!
bal_127.
en_128. I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’
bal_128.
en_129. and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings.
bal_129.
en_130. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room.
bal_130.
en_131. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken.
bal_131.
en_132. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.
bal_132.
en_133. “The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us.
bal_133.
en_134. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman.
bal_134.
en_135. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him.
bal_135.
en_136. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment.
bal_136.
en_137. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent.
bal_137.
en_138. I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed.
bal_138.
en_139. They are as follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green.
bal_139.
en_140. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.

bal_146.
en_147. “My dearest Lucy,-- “Such a sad blow has befallen us.
bal_147.
en_148. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
bal_148.
en_149. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father.
bal_149.
en_150. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me.
bal_150.
en_151. Jonathan is greatly distressed.
bal_151.
en_152. It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account.
bal_152.
en_153. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous.
bal_153.
en_154. He begins to doubt himself.
bal_154.
en_155. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_ helps him to have a belief in himself.
bal_155.
en_156. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.
bal_156.
en_157. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone.
bal_157.
en_158. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in.
bal_158.
en_159. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father.
bal_159.
en_160. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner.
bal_160.
en_161. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes.

en_164. _Dr. Seward’s Diary._ _20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night.
bal_164.
en_165. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.
bal_165.
en_166. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy’s mother and Arthur’s father, and now....
bal_166.
en_167. Let me get on with my work.
bal_167.
en_168. I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.
bal_168.
en_169. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.
bal_169.
en_170. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.
bal_170.
en_171. Van Helsing was very kind to him.
bal_171.
en_172. “Come, my child,” he said; “come with me.
bal_172.
en_173. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of.
bal_173.
en_174. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
bal_174.
en_175. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas.
bal_175.
en_176. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.”
bal_176.
en_177. Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.
bal_177.
en_178. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be.
bal_178.
en_179. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers.
bal_179.
en_180. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.
bal_180.
en_181. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.
bal_181.
en_182. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.
bal_182.
en_183. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily.
bal_183.
en_184. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window.
bal_184.
en_185. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind.
bal_185.
en_186. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now and again struck the window with its wings.
bal_186.
en_187. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.
bal_187.
en_188. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.
bal_188.
en_189. Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
bal_189.
en_190. She took but a little, and that languidly.
bal_190.
en_191. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness.
bal_191.
en_192. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her.
bal_192.
en_193. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close.
bal_193.
en_194. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
bal_194.
en_195. At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.
bal_195.
en_196. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.
bal_196.
en_197. When he saw Lucy’s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!”
bal_197.
en_198. Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully.
bal_198.
en_199. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.
bal_199.
en_200. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein Gott!”
bal_200.
en_201. as it was smothered in his throat.
bal_201.
en_202. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
bal_202.
en_203. The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
bal_203.
en_204. For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest.
bal_204.
en_205. Then he turned to me and said calmly:-- “She is dying.
bal_205.
en_206. It will not be long now.
bal_206.
en_207. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep.
bal_207.
en_208. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”
bal_208.
en_209. I went to the dining-room and waked him.
bal_209.
en_210. He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear.
bal_210.
en_211. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing
bal_211.
en_212. and I feared that the end was near.
bal_212.
en_213. He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief.
bal_213.
en_214. I took him by the hand and raised him up.
bal_214.
en_215. “Come,” I said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.”
bal_215.
en_216. When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible.
bal_216.
en_217. He had even brushed Lucy’s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.
bal_217.
en_218. When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:-- “Arthur!
bal_218.
en_219. Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!”
bal_219.
en_220. He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back.
bal_220.
en_221. “No,” he whispered, “not yet!
bal_221.
en_222. Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
bal_222.
en_223. So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.
bal_223.
en_224. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.
bal_224.
en_225. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.
bal_225.
en_226. And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night.
bal_226.
en_227. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.
bal_227.
en_228. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:-- “Arthur!
bal_228.
en_229. Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!
bal_229.
en_230. Kiss me!”
bal_230.
en_231. Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.
bal_231.
en_232. “Not for your life!”
bal_232.
en_233. he said; “not for your living soul and hers!”
bal_233.
en_234. And he stood between them like a lion at bay.
bal_234.
en_235. Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
bal_235.
en_236. I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed together.
bal_236.
en_237. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
bal_237.
en_238. Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it.
bal_238.
en_239. “My true friend,” she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his!
bal_239.
en_240. Oh, guard him, and give me peace!”
bal_240.
en_241. “I swear it!”
bal_241.
en_242. he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath.
bal_242.
en_243. Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once.”
bal_243.
en_244. Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
bal_244.
en_245. Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
bal_245.
en_246. And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.
bal_246.
en_247. “It is all over,” said Van Helsing.
bal_247.
en_248. “She is dead!”
bal_248.
en_249. I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.
bal_249.
en_250. I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever.
bal_250.
en_251. Some change had come over her body.
bal_251.
en_252. Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.
bal_252.
en_253. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.
bal_253.
en_254. “We thought her dying whilst she slept, And sleeping when she died.”
bal_254.
en_255. I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:-- “Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last.
bal_255.
en_256. It is the end!”
bal_256.
en_257. He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:-- “Not so; alas!
bal_257.
en_258. not so.
bal_258.
en_259. It is only the beginning!”
bal_259.
en_260. When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:-- “We can do nothing as yet.
bal_260.
en_261. Wait and see.”
bal_261.
en_262. CHAPTER XIII DR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.
bal_262.
en_263. The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together.
bal_263.
en_264. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
bal_264.
en_265. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:-- “She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.
bal_265.
en_266. It’s quite a privilege to attend on her.
bal_266.
en_267. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!”
bal_267.
en_268. I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.
bal_268.
en_269. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household.
bal_269.
en_270. There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden.
bal_270.
en_271. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc.
bal_271.
en_272. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s papers himself.
bal_272.
en_273. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble.
bal_273.
en_274. He answered me:-- “I know; I know.
bal_274.
en_275. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor.
bal_275.
en_276. But this is not altogether for the law.
bal_276.
en_277. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner.
bal_277.
en_278. I have more than him to avoid.
bal_278.
en_279. There may be papers more--such as this.”
bal_279.
en_280. As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
bal_280.
en_281. “When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night.
bal_281.
en_282. For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself search for what may be.
bal_282.
en_283. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.”
bal_283.
en_284. I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to him.
bal_284.
en_285. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given.
bal_285.
en_286. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:-- “Can I help you, friend John?
bal_286.
en_287. I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.”
bal_287.
en_288. “Have you got what you looked for?”
bal_288.
en_289. I asked, to which he replied:-- “I did not look for any specific thing.
bal_289.
en_290. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun.
bal_290.
en_291. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them.
bal_291.
en_292. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.”
bal_292.
en_293. When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:-- “And now, friend John, I think we may to bed.
bal_293.
en_294. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate.
bal_294.
en_295. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us.
bal_295.
en_296. Alas!”
bal_296.
en_297. Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.
bal_297.
en_298. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small _chapelle ardente_.
bal_298.
en_299. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be.
bal_299.
en_300. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.
bal_300.
en_301. All Lucy’s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.
bal_301.
en_302. The Professor looked sternly grave.
bal_302.
en_303. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.
bal_303.
en_304. He said to me: “Remain till I return,” and left the room.
bal_304.
en_305. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed.
bal_305.
en_306. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth.
bal_306.
en_307. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.
bal_307.
en_308. I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak:-- “To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives.”
bal_308.
en_309. “Must we make an autopsy?”
bal_309.
en_310. I asked.
bal_310.
en_311. “Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think.
bal_311.
en_312. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another.
bal_312.
en_313. I want to cut off her head and take out her heart.
bal_313.
en_314. Ah!
bal_314.
en_315. you a surgeon, and so shocked!
bal_315.
en_316. You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder.
bal_316.
en_317. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help.
bal_317.
en_318. I would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow, and he will want to see her--to see _it_.
bal_318.
en_319. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.
bal_319.
en_320. We shall unscrew
bal_320.

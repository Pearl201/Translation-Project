en_1. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.
bal_1.
en_2. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
bal_2.
en_3. By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.
bal_3.
en_4. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.
bal_4.
en_5. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.
bal_5.
en_6. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
bal_6.
en_7. “Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me.
bal_7.
en_8. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.
bal_8.
en_9. How shall I ever repay you?
bal_9.
en_10. I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”
bal_10.
en_11. “You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject,
bal_11.
en_12. may I not?” I trembled.
bal_12.
en_13. One subject!
bal_13.
en_14. What could it be?
bal_14.
en_15. Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?
bal_15.
en_16. “Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
bal_16.
en_17. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.”
bal_17.
en_18. “Is that all, my dear Henry?
bal_18.
en_19. How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?”
bal_19.
en_20. “If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.”
bal_20.
en_21. Chapter 6 Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
bal_21.
en_22. It was from my own Elizabeth: “My dearest Cousin, “You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.
bal_22.
en_23. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.
bal_23.
en_24. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.
bal_24.
en_25. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!
bal_25.
en_26. I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.
bal_26.
en_27. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.
bal_27.
en_28. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
bal_28.
en_29. “Get well—and return to us.
bal_29.
en_30. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.
bal_30.
en_31. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
bal_31.
en_32. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!
bal_32.
en_33. He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.
bal_33.
en_34. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.
bal_34.
en_35. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.
bal_35.
en_36. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.
bal_36.
en_37. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
bal_37.
en_38. “Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.
bal_38.
en_39. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.
bal_39.
en_40. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.
bal_40.
en_41. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.
bal_41.
en_42. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?
bal_42.
en_43. Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.
bal_43.
en_44. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.
bal_44.
en_45. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.
bal_45.
en_46. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
bal_46.
en_47. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.
bal_47.
en_48. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.
bal_48.
en_49. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.
bal_49.
en_50. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
bal_50.
en_51. “Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy.
bal_51.
en_52. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.
bal_52.
en_53. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
bal_53.
en_54. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.
bal_54.
en_55. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
bal_55.
en_56. “When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.
bal_56.
en_57. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.
bal_57.
en_58. “One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.
bal_58.
en_59. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.
bal_59.
en_60. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.
bal_60.
en_61. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.
bal_61.
en_62. Poor girl!
bal_62.
en_63. She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.
bal_63.
en_64. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.
bal_64.
en_65. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
bal_65.
en_66. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
bal_66.
en_67. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.
bal_67.
en_68. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.
bal_68.
en_69. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.
bal_69.
en_70. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
bal_70.
en_71. “I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.
bal_71.
en_72. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.
bal_72.
en_73. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.
bal_73.
en_74. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
bal_74.
en_75. “Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.
bal_75.
en_76. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.
bal_76.
en_77. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.
bal_77.
en_78. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.
bal_78.
en_79. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.
bal_79.
en_80. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.
bal_80.
en_81. “I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.
bal_81.
en_82. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one word will be a blessing to us.
bal_82.
en_83. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.
bal_83.
en_84. Adieu!
bal_84.
en_85. my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!
bal_85.
en_86. “Elizabeth Lavenza.
bal_86.
en_87. “Geneva, March 18th, 17—.” “Dear, dear Elizabeth!”
bal_87.
en_88. I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.”
bal_88.
en_89. I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.
bal_89.
en_90. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
bal_90.
en_91. One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.
bal_91.
en_92. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.
bal_92.
en_93. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
bal_93.
en_94. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
bal_94.
en_95. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.
bal_95.
en_96. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.
bal_96.
en_97. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
bal_97.
en_98. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.
bal_98.
en_99. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.
bal_99.
en_100. What could I do?
bal_100.
en_101. He meant to please, and he tormented me.
bal_101.
en_102. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.
bal_102.
en_103. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
bal_103.
en_104. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.
bal_104.
en_105. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.
bal_105.
en_106. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
bal_106.
en_107. M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.
bal_107.
en_108. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.
bal_108.
en_109. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.
bal_109.
en_110. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay, ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
bal_110.
en_111. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”
bal_111.
en_112. M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
bal_112.
en_113. Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.
bal_113.
en_114. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.
bal_114.
en_115. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.
bal_115.
en_116. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.
bal_116.
en_117. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.
bal_117.
en_118. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.
bal_118.
en_119. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.
bal_119.
en_120. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.
bal_120.
en_121. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.
bal_121.
en_122. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
bal_122.
en_123. Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.
bal_123.
en_124. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.
bal_124.
en_125. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.
bal_125.
en_126. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
bal_126.
en_127. The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.
bal_127.
en_128. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.
bal_128.
en_129. We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.
bal_129.
en_130. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
bal_130.
en_131. Excellent friend!
bal_131.
en_132. how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.
bal_132.
en_133. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
bal_133.
en_134. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.
bal_134.
en_135. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
bal_135.
en_136. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.
bal_136.
en_137. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.
bal_137.
en_138. Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.
bal_138.
en_139. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.
bal_139.
en_140. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
bal_140.
en_141. We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.
bal_141.
en_142. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
bal_142.
en_143. Chapter 7
bal_143.
en_144. On my return, I found the following letter from my father:— “My dear Victor, “You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.
bal_144.
en_145. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
bal_145.
en_146. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
bal_146.
en_147. And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?
bal_147.
en_148. Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?
bal_148.
en_149. I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
bal_149.
en_150. “William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!
bal_150.
en_151. Victor, he is murdered!
bal_151.
en_152. “I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.
bal_152.
en_153. “Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.
bal_153.
en_154. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.
bal_154.
en_155. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.
bal_155.
en_156. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
bal_156.
en_157. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
bal_157.
en_158. “This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.
bal_158.
en_159. He was not there.
bal_159.
en_160. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.
bal_160.
en_161. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.
bal_161.
en_162. “He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.
bal_162.
en_163. She was very earnest to see the corpse.
bal_163.
en_164. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God!
bal_164.
en_165. I have murdered my darling child!’
bal_165.
en_166. “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.
bal_166.
en_167. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.
bal_167.
en_168. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.
bal_168.
en_169. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.
bal_169.
en_170. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
bal_170.
en_171. “Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.
bal_171.
en_172. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.
bal_172.
en_173. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
bal_173.
en_174. Your dear mother!
bal_174.
en_175. Alas, Victor!
bal_175.
en_176. I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
bal_176.
en_177. “Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.
bal_177.
en_178. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.
bal_178.
en_179. “Your affectionate and afflicted father, “Alphonse Frankenstein.
bal_179.
en_180. “Geneva, May 12th, 17—.” Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends.
bal_180.
en_181. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.
bal_181.
en_182. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy?
bal_182.
en_183. My dear friend, what has happened?”
bal_183.
en_184. I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.
bal_184.
en_185. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
bal_185.
en_186. “I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
bal_186.
en_187. What do you intend to do?”
bal_187.
en_188. “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”
bal_188.
en_189. During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.
bal_189.
en_190. “Poor William!” said he, “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!
bal_190.
en_191. Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!
bal_191.
en_192. To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp!
bal_192.
en_193. How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!
bal_193.
en_194. Poor little fellow!
bal_194.
en_195. one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.
bal_195.
en_196. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
bal_196.
en_197. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.
bal_197.
en_198. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.”
bal_198.
en_199. Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.
bal_199.
en_200. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
bal_200.
en_201. My journey was very melancholy.
bal_201.
en_202. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.
bal_202.
en_203. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.
bal_203.
en_204. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
bal_204.
en_205. How altered every thing might be during that time!
bal_205.
en_206. One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.
bal_206.
en_207. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.
bal_207.
en_208. I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.
bal_208.
en_209. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed.
bal_209.
en_210. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.
bal_210.
en_211. The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.
bal_211.
en_212. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.
bal_212.
en_213. I wept like a child.
bal_213.
en_214. “Dear mountains!
bal_214.
en_215. my own beautiful lake!
bal_215.
en_216. how do you welcome your wanderer?
bal_216.
en_217. Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.
bal_217.
en_218. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”
bal_218.
en_219. I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.
bal_219.
en_220. My country, my beloved country!
bal_220.
en_221. who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!
bal_221.
en_222. Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.
bal_222.
en_223. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.
bal_223.
en_224. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.
bal_224.
en_225. Alas!
bal_225.
en_226. I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
bal_226.
en_227. It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.
bal_227.
en_228. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.
bal_228.
en_229. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
bal_229.
en_230. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.
bal_230.
en_231. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.
bal_231.
en_232. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
bal_232.
en_233. I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.
bal_233.
en_234. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.
bal_234.
en_235. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.
bal_235.
en_236. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt.
bal_236.
en_237. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.
bal_237.
en_238. While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.
bal_238.
en_239. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel!
bal_239.
en_240. this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!”
bal_240.
en_241. As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.
bal_241.
en_242. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life.
bal_242.
en_243. What did he there?
bal_243.
en_244. Could he be (I shuddered at the conception)
bal_244.
en_245. the murderer of my brother?
bal_245.
en_246. No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.
bal_246.
en_247. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.
bal_247.
en_248. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.
bal_248.
en_249. _
bal_249.
en_250. He_ was the murderer!
bal_250.
en_251. I could not doubt it.
bal_251.
en_252. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
bal_252.
en_253. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.
bal_253.
en_254. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
bal_254.
en_255. I remained motionless.
bal_255.
en_256. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.
bal_256.
en_257. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.
bal_257.
en_258. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?
bal_258.
en_259. Alas!
bal_259.
en_260. I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?
bal_260.
en_261. No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.
bal_261.
en_262. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
bal_262.
en_263. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.
bal_263.
en_264. Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.
bal_264.
en_265. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father’s house.
bal_265.
en_266. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.
bal_266.
en_267. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.
bal_267.
en_268. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.
bal_268.
en_269. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.
bal_269.
en_270. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.
bal_270.
en_271. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.
bal_271.
en_272. And then of what use would be pursuit?
bal_272.
en_273. Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve?
bal_273.
en_274. These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.
bal_274.
en_275. It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.
bal_275.
en_276. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.
bal_276.
en_277. Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
bal_277.
en_278. Beloved and venerable parent!
bal_278.
en_279. He still remained to me.
bal_279.
en_280. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.
bal_280.
en_281. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.
bal_281.
en_282. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.
bal_282.
en_283. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
bal_283.
en_284. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he.
bal_284.
en_285. “Ah!
bal_285.
en_286. I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
bal_286.
en_287. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William!
bal_287.
en_288. he was our darling and our pride!”
bal_288.
en_289. Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.
bal_289.
en_290. Before, I had only imagined
bal_290.

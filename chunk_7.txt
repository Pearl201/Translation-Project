en_1. doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity
bal_1.
en_2. ,” said Elizabeth warmly, “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.
bal_2.
en_3. Mr. Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.”
bal_3.
en_4. She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.
bal_4.
en_5. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.
bal_5.
en_6. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.
bal_6.
en_7. “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness.
bal_7.
en_8. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother, Lady Catherine.
bal_8.
en_9. How wonderfully these sort of things occur!
bal_9.
en_10. Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!
bal_10.
en_11. I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.
bal_11.
en_12. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
bal_12.
en_13. “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”
bal_13.
en_14. “Indeed I am.
bal_14.
en_15. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
bal_15.
en_16. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_.
bal_16.
en_17. It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
bal_17.
en_18. Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.
bal_18.
en_19. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,-- “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.
bal_19.
en_20. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.
bal_20.
en_21. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
bal_21.
en_22. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”
bal_22.
en_23. It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.
bal_23.
en_24. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.
bal_24.
en_25. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
bal_25.
en_26. “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception.
bal_26.
en_27. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
bal_27.
en_28. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.
bal_28.
en_29. It was really a very handsome thought.
bal_29.
en_30. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
bal_30.
en_31. As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.
bal_31.
en_32. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters.
bal_32.
en_33. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.
bal_33.
en_34. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.
bal_34.
en_35. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.
bal_35.
en_36. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.
bal_36.
en_37. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.
bal_37.
en_38. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.
bal_38.
en_39. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.
bal_39.
en_40. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.
bal_40.
en_41. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
bal_41.
en_42. “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?
bal_42.
en_43. I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _
bal_43.
en_44. he_ may not like to hear.”
bal_44.
en_45. “For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower.
bal_45.
en_46. What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?
bal_46.
en_47. You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.”
bal_47.
en_48. Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.
bal_48.
en_49. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
bal_49.
en_50. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.
bal_50.
en_51. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.
bal_51.
en_52. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
bal_52.
en_53. At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
bal_53.
en_54. Elizabeth now began to revive.
bal_54.
en_55. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.
bal_55.
en_56. By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
bal_56.
en_57. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
bal_57.
en_58. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.
bal_58.
en_59. Elizabeth was in agonies.
bal_59.
en_60. She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.
bal_60.
en_61. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave.
bal_61.
en_62. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.
bal_62.
en_63. He took the hint, and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,-- “That will do extremely well, child.
bal_63.
en_64. You have delighted us long enough.
bal_64.
en_65. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
bal_65.
en_66. Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.
bal_66.
en_67. Others of the party were now applied to.
bal_67.
en_68. “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.
bal_68.
en_69. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.
bal_69.
en_70. The rector of a parish has much to do.
bal_70.
en_71. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.
bal_71.
en_72. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.
bal_72.
en_73. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
bal_73.
en_74. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.”
bal_74.
en_75. And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
bal_75.
en_76. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
bal_76.
en_77. To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.
bal_77.
en_78. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
bal_78.
en_79. The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.
bal_79.
en_80. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.
bal_80.
en_81. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
bal_81.
en_82. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.
bal_82.
en_83. There was no arguing upon such a project.
bal_83.
en_84. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.
bal_84.
en_85. She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.
bal_85.
en_86. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.
bal_86.
en_87. The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.
bal_87.
en_88. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.
bal_88.
en_89. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.
bal_89.
en_90. Darcy said nothing at all.
bal_90.
en_91. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
bal_91.
en_92. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.
bal_92.
en_93. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!”
bal_93.
en_94. accompanied by a violent yawn.
bal_94.
en_95. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.
bal_95.
en_96. Bingley was all grateful pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.
bal_96.
en_97. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.
bal_97.
en_98. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
bal_98.
en_99. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
bal_99.
en_100. “He vowed with utmost fervour”
bal_100.
en_101. “Dawn broke on a fateful morning” The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.
bal_101.
en_102. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.
bal_102.
en_103. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.
bal_103.
en_104. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--
bal_104.
en_105. “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?”
bal_105.
en_106. Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,-- “Oh dear!
bal_106.
en_107. Yes, certainly.
bal_107.
en_108. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.
bal_108.
en_109. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.”
bal_109.
en_110. And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,-- “Dear ma’am, do not go.
bal_110.
en_111. I beg you will not go.
bal_111.
en_112. Mr. Collins must excuse me.
bal_112.
en_113. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
bal_113.
en_114. I am going away myself.”
bal_114.
en_115. “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.
bal_115.
en_116. I desire you will stay where you are.”
bal_116.
en_117. And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”
bal_117.
en_118. Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.
bal_118.
en_119. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,-- “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.
bal_119.
en_120. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother’s permission for this address.
bal_120.
en_121. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
bal_121.
en_122. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
bal_122.
en_123. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
bal_123.
en_124. The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued,-- “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
bal_124.
en_125. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)
bal_125.
en_126. on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry.
bal_126.
en_127. A clergyman like you must marry.
bal_127.
en_128. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.
bal_128.
en_129. This is my advice.
bal_129.
en_130. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’
bal_130.
en_131. Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.
bal_131.
en_132. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.
bal_132.
en_133. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.
bal_133.
en_134. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.
bal_134.
en_135. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.
bal_135.
en_136. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.
bal_136.
en_137. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.
bal_137.
en_138. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
bal_138.
en_139. It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
bal_139.
en_140. “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.
bal_140.
en_141. “You forget that I have made no answer.
bal_141.
en_142. Let me do it without further loss of time.
bal_142.
en_143. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.
bal_143.
en_144. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them.”
bal_144.
en_145. “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.
bal_145.
en_146. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
bal_146.
en_147. “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.
bal_147.
en_148. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.
bal_148.
en_149. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.
bal_149.
en_150. You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_
bal_150.
en_151. so.
bal_151.
en_152. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”
bal_152.
en_153. “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins, very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you.
bal_153.
en_154. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.”
bal_154.
en_155. “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
bal_155.
en_156. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.
bal_156.
en_157. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
bal_157.
en_158. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.
bal_158.
en_159. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.”
bal_159.
en_160. And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,--
bal_160.
en_161. “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”
bal_161.
en_162. “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me exceedingly.
bal_162.
en_163. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.”
bal_163.
en_164. “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course.
bal_164.
en_165. My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.
bal_165.
en_166. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
bal_166.
en_167. Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.
bal_167.
en_168. As I must, therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
bal_168.
en_169. “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.
bal_169.
en_170. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.
bal_170.
en_171. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.
bal_171.
en_172. My feelings in every respect forbid it.
bal_172.
en_173. Can I speak plainer?
bal_173.
en_174. Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.”
bal_174.
en_175. “You are uniformly charming!”
bal_175.
en_176. cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.”
bal_176.
en_177. To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
bal_177.
en_178. “Sunlight fell across the empty hall”
bal_178.
en_179. “Footsteps hastened from the vestibule” Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.
bal_179.
en_180. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
bal_180.
en_181. This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.
bal_181.
en_182. “But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.
bal_182.
en_183. I will speak to her about it myself directly.
bal_183.
en_184. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.”
bal_184.
en_185. “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.
bal_185.
en_186. If, therefore, she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
bal_186.
en_187. “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
bal_187.
en_188. “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.
bal_188.
en_189. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.
bal_189.
en_190. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
bal_190.
en_191. She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out, as she entered the library,-- “Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
bal_191.
en_192. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”
bal_192.
en_193. Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by her communication.
bal_193.
en_194. “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had finished her speech.
bal_194.
en_195. “Of what are you talking?”
bal_195.
en_196. “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.
bal_196.
en_197. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
bal_197.
en_198. “And what am I to do on the occasion?
bal_198.
en_199. It seems a hopeless business.”
bal_199.
en_200. “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.
bal_200.
en_201. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.”
bal_201.
en_202. “Let her be called down.
bal_202.
en_203. She shall hear my opinion.”
bal_203.
en_204. Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.
bal_204.
en_205. “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.
bal_205.
en_206. “I have sent for you on an affair of importance.
bal_206.
en_207. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.
bal_207.
en_208. Is it true?”
bal_208.
en_209. Elizabeth replied that it was.
bal_209.
en_210. “Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
bal_210.
en_211. “I have, sir.”
bal_211.
en_212. “Very well.
bal_212.
en_213. We now come to the point.
bal_213.
en_214. Your mother insists upon your accepting it.
bal_214.
en_215. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
bal_215.
en_216. “Yes, or I will never see her again.”
bal_216.
en_217. “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.
bal_217.
en_218. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.
bal_218.
en_219. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.”
bal_219.
en_220. Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
bal_220.
en_221. “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?
bal_221.
en_222. You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”
bal_222.
en_223. “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
bal_223.
en_224. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and, secondly, of my room.
bal_224.
en_225. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.”
bal_225.
en_226. Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point.
bal_226.
en_227. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
bal_227.
en_228. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.
bal_228.
en_229. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
bal_229.
en_230. Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
bal_230.
en_231. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.
bal_231.
en_232. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
bal_232.
en_233. While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.
bal_233.
en_234. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!
bal_234.
en_235. What do you think has happened this morning?
bal_235.
en_236. Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
bal_236.
en_237. “They hurried into the morning parlour”
bal_237.
en_238. Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family.
bal_238.
en_239. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone; “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
bal_239.
en_240. Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
bal_240.
en_241. “Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.
bal_241.
en_242. But I tell you what,
bal_242.

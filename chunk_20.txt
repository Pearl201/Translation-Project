en_1. of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could.
bal_1.
en_2. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of seeing him before.
bal_2.
en_3. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.
bal_3.
en_4. Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.
bal_4.
en_5. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.
bal_5.
en_6. “There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
bal_6.
en_7. “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.”
bal_7.
en_8. “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.
bal_8.
en_9. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”
bal_9.
en_10. “Good gracious!
bal_10.
en_11. Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow.
bal_11.
en_12. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.”
bal_12.
en_13. Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.
bal_13.
en_14. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.
bal_14.
en_15. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.
bal_15.
en_16. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them.
bal_16.
en_17. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
bal_17.
en_18. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.
bal_18.
en_19. Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
bal_19.
en_20. The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
bal_20.
en_21. “Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early enough for expectation.”
bal_21.
en_22. She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.
bal_22.
en_23. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.
bal_23.
en_24. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
bal_24.
en_25. Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.
bal_25.
en_26. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.
bal_26.
en_27. He looked serious as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.
bal_27.
en_28. But, perhaps, he could not in her mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.
bal_28.
en_29. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
bal_29.
en_30. Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.
bal_30.
en_31. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend.
bal_31.
en_32. Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.
bal_32.
en_33. Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything.
bal_33.
en_34. He was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
bal_34.
en_35. There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself.
bal_35.
en_36. But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
bal_36.
en_37. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.
bal_37.
en_38. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.
bal_38.
en_39. “Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she.
bal_39.
en_40. “Yet why did he come?”
bal_40.
en_41. She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.
bal_41.
en_42. She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
bal_42.
en_43. “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
bal_43.
en_44. He readily agreed to it.
bal_44.
en_45. “I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
bal_45.
en_46. People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.
bal_46.
en_47. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away.
bal_47.
en_48. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my own daughters.
bal_48.
en_49. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.
bal_49.
en_50. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.
bal_50.
en_51. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
bal_51.
en_52. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.
bal_52.
en_53. Did you see it?”
bal_53.
en_54. Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.
bal_54.
en_55. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.
bal_55.
en_56. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
bal_56.
en_57. “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken away from me.
bal_57.
en_58. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.
bal_58.
en_59. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.
bal_59.
en_60. Thank heaven!
bal_60.
en_61. he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he deserves.”
bal_61.
en_62. Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat.
bal_62.
en_63. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.
bal_63.
en_64. A few weeks, he believed.
bal_64.
en_65. “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother, “I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet’s manor.
bal_65.
en_66. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the coveys for you.”
bal_66.
en_67. Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious attention!
bal_67.
en_68. Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.
bal_68.
en_69. At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.
bal_69.
en_70. “The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them.
bal_70.
en_71. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!
bal_71.
en_72. Let me never see either one or the other again!”
bal_72.
en_73. Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover.
bal_73.
en_74. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
bal_74.
en_75. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.
bal_75.
en_76. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.
bal_76.
en_77. When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days’ time.
bal_77.
en_78. “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned.
bal_78.
en_79. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.”
bal_79.
en_80. Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.
bal_80.
en_81. They then went away.
bal_81.
en_82. Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.
bal_82.
en_83. [Illustration: “Jane happened to look round” ] CHAPTER LIV.
bal_83.
en_84. [Illustration] As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more.
bal_84.
en_85. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.
bal_85.
en_86. “Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did he come at all?”
bal_86.
en_87. She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
bal_87.
en_88. “He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?
bal_88.
en_89. If he fears me, why come hither?
bal_89.
en_90. If he no longer cares for me, why silent?
bal_90.
en_91. Teasing, teasing man!
bal_91.
en_92. I will think no more about him.”
bal_92.
en_93. Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.
bal_93.
en_94. “Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.
bal_94.
en_95. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.
bal_95.
en_96. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.
bal_96.
en_97. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”
bal_97.
en_98. “Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly.
bal_98.
en_99. “Oh, Jane! take care.”
bal_99.
en_100. “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”
bal_100.
en_101. “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.”
bal_101.
en_102. They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.
bal_102.
en_103. On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.
bal_103.
en_104. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.
bal_104.
en_105. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.
bal_105.
en_106. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.
bal_106.
en_107. He placed himself by her.
bal_107.
en_108. Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
bal_108.
en_109. He bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
bal_109.
en_110. His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.
bal_110.
en_111. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.
bal_111.
en_112. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.
bal_112.
en_113. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.
bal_113.
en_114. He was on one side of her mother.
bal_114.
en_115. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.
bal_115.
en_116. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.
bal_116.
en_117. Her mother’s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
bal_117.
en_118. She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.
bal_118.
en_119. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
bal_119.
en_120. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
bal_120.
en_121. “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for ever.”
bal_121.
en_122. The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!
bal_122.
en_123. the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair.
bal_123.
en_124. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,-- “The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined.
bal_124.
en_125. We want none of them; do we?”
bal_125.
en_126. Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.
bal_126.
en_127. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!
bal_127.
en_128. “A man who has once been refused!
bal_128.
en_129. How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
bal_129.
en_130. Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
bal_130.
en_131. There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”
bal_131.
en_132. She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,-- “Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
bal_132.
en_133. “Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”
bal_133.
en_134. “And quite alone?
bal_134.
en_135. Have all her friends left her?”
bal_135.
en_136. “Mrs. Annesley is with her.
bal_136.
en_137. The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks.”
bal_137.
en_138. She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.
bal_138.
en_139. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
bal_139.
en_140. When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.
bal_140.
en_141. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
bal_141.
en_142. They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
bal_142.
en_143. Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
bal_143.
en_144. “Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what say you to the day?
bal_144.
en_145. I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.
bal_145.
en_146. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.
bal_146.
en_147. The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.
bal_147.
en_148. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.
bal_148.
en_149. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.
bal_149.
en_150. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.
bal_150.
en_151. And what do you think she said besides?
bal_151.
en_152. ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last!’
bal_152.
en_153. She did, indeed.
bal_153.
en_154. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
bal_154.
en_155. [Illustration: “M^{rs}.
bal_155.
en_156. Long and her nieces.”
bal_156.
en_157. ] Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
bal_157.
en_158. “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.
bal_158.
en_159. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.
bal_159.
en_160. I hope we may often meet again.”
bal_160.
en_161. Elizabeth smiled.
bal_161.
en_162. “Lizzy, you must not do so.
bal_162.
en_163. You must not suspect me.
bal_163.
en_164. It mortifies me.
bal_164.
en_165. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it.
bal_165.
en_166. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.
bal_166.
en_167. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”
bal_167.
en_168. “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”
bal_168.
en_169. “How hard it is in some cases to be believed!
bal_169.
en_170. And how impossible in others!
bal_170.
en_171. But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?”
bal_171.
en_172. “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.
bal_172.
en_173. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
bal_173.
en_174. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante.”
bal_174.
en_175. [Illustration: “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”
bal_175.
en_176. ] CHAPTER LV.
bal_176.
en_177. [Illustration] A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.
bal_177.
en_178. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days’ time.
bal_178.
en_179. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.
bal_179.
en_180. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
bal_180.
en_181. “Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
bal_181.
en_182. He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
bal_182.
en_183. “Can you come to-morrow?”
bal_183.
en_184. Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.
bal_184.
en_185. He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.
bal_185.
en_186. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,-- “My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.
bal_186.
en_187. He is come--Mr. Bingley is come.
bal_187.
en_188. He is, indeed.
bal_188.
en_189. Make haste, make haste.
bal_189.
en_190. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.
bal_190.
en_191. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”
bal_191.
en_192. “We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”
bal_192.
en_193. “Oh! hang Kitty!
bal_193.
en_194. what has she to do with it?
bal_194.
en_195. Come, be quick, be quick!
bal_195.
en_196. where is your sash, my dear?”
bal_196.
en_197. But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.
bal_197.
en_198. The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.
bal_198.
en_199. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument.
bal_199.
en_200. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.
bal_200.
en_201. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma?
bal_201.
en_202. What do you keep winking at me for?
bal_202.
en_203. What am I to do?”
bal_203.
en_204. “Nothing, child, nothing.
bal_204.
en_205. I did not wink at you.”
bal_205.
en_206. She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,-- “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
bal_206.
en_207. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that _
bal_207.
en_208. she_ would not give in to it.
bal_208.
en_209. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,-- “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
bal_209.
en_210. Elizabeth was forced to go.
bal_210.
en_211. “We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.
bal_211.
en_212. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.”
bal_212.
en_213. Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.
bal_213.
en_214. Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual.
bal_214.
en_215. Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.
bal_215.
en_216. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
bal_216.
en_217. He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
bal_217.
en_218. After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.
bal_218.
en_219. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.
bal_219.
en_220. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.
bal_220.
en_221. Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.
bal_221.
en_222. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.
bal_222.
en_223. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.
bal_223.
en_224. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter.
bal_224.
en_225. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
bal_225.
en_226. But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.
bal_226.
en_227. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all.
bal_227.
en_228. _
bal_228.
en_229. Their_ situation was awkward enough; but
bal_229.
en_230. _hers_
bal_230.
en_231. she thought was still worse.
bal_231.
en_232. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and, whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
bal_232.
en_233. Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
bal_233.
en_234. “’Tis too much!”
bal_234.
en_235. she added, “by far too much.
bal_235.
en_236. I do not deserve it.
bal_236.
en_237. Oh, why is not everybody as happy?”
bal_237.
en_238. Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.
bal_238.
en_239. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.
bal_239.
en_240. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.
bal_240.
en_241. “I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried.
bal_241.
en_242. “I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.
bal_242.
en_243. He is gone to my father already.
bal_243.
en_244. Oh, Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
bal_244.
en_245. how shall I bear so much happiness?”
bal_245.
en_246. She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.
bal_246.
en_247. Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.
bal_247.
en_248. “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious circumspection!
bal_248.
en_249. of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!
bal_249.
en_250. the happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”
bal_250.
en_251. In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.
bal_251.
en_252. “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
bal_252.
en_253. “With my mother upstairs.
bal_253.
en_254. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
bal_254.
en_255. He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.
bal_255.
en_256. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.
bal_256.
en_257. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.
bal_257.
en_258. It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.
bal_258.
en_259. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
bal_259.
en_260. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.
bal_260.
en_261. Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,-- “Jane, I congratulate you.
bal_261.
en_262. You will be a very happy woman.”
bal_262.
en_263. Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
bal_263.
en_264. “You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.
bal_264.
en_265. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.
bal_265.
en_266. Your tempers are by no means unlike.
bal_266.
en_267. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”
bal_267.
en_268. “I hope not so.
bal_268.
en_269. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_.”
bal_269.
en_270. “Exceed their income!
bal_270.
en_271. My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you talking of?
bal_271.
en_272. Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.”
bal_272.
en_273. Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!
bal_273.
en_274. I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night.
bal_274.
en_275. I knew how it would be.
bal_275.
en_276. I always said it must be so, at last.
bal_276.
en_277. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!
bal_277.
en_278. I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.
bal_278.
en_279. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!”
bal_279.
en_280. Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.
bal_280.
en_281. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.
bal_281.
en_282. At that moment she cared for no other.
bal_282.
en_283. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.
bal_283.
en_284. Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
bal_284.
en_285. Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.
bal_285.
en_286. Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.
bal_286.
en_287. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
bal_287.
en_288. “He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!
bal_288.
en_289. I had not believed it possible.”
bal_289.
en_290. “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth.
bal_290.
en_291. “But how did he account for it?”
bal_291.
en_292. “It must have been his sisters’ doing.
bal_292.
en_293. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.
bal_293.
en_294. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we can never be what we once were to each other.”
bal_294.
en_295. “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever heard you utter.
bal_295.
en_296. Good girl!
bal_296.
en_297. It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”
bal_297.
en_298. “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again?”
bal_298.
en_299. “He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.”
bal_299.
en_300. This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.
bal_300.
en_301. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
bal_301.
en_302. “I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane.
bal_302.
en_303. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all?
bal_303.
en_304. If I could but see you as happy!
bal_304.
en_305. If there were but such another man for you!”
bal_305.
en_306. “If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.
bal_306.
en_307. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.
bal_307.
en_308. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
bal_308.
en_309. The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.
bal_309.
en_310. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.
bal_310.
en_311. The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
bal_311.
en_312. [Illustration] CHAPTER LVI.
bal_312.
en_313. [Illustration] One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.
bal_313.
en_314. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
bal_314.
en_315. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.
bal_315.
en_316. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming,

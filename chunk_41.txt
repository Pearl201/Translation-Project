en_1. stowing that out of sight.
bal_1.
en_2. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
bal_2.
en_3. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.
bal_3.
en_4. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.
bal_4.
en_5. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.
bal_5.
en_6. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.
bal_6.
en_7. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.
bal_7.
en_8. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.
bal_8.
en_9. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.
bal_9.
en_10. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth.
bal_10.
en_11. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles.
bal_11.
en_12. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.
bal_12.
en_13. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.
bal_13.
en_14. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.
bal_14.
en_15. That is why there are night-lights.
bal_15.
en_16. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.
bal_16.
en_17. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him.
bal_17.
en_18. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.
bal_18.
en_19. “Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret.
bal_19.
en_20. Her mother had been questioning her.
bal_20.
en_21. “But who is he, my pet?”
bal_21.
en_22. “He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”
bal_22.
en_23. At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.
bal_23.
en_24. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
bal_24.
en_25. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
bal_25.
en_26. “Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”
bal_26.
en_27. “Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is just my size.”
bal_27.
en_28. She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.
bal_28.
en_29. Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.
bal_29.
en_30. “Mark my words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.
bal_30.
en_31. Leave it alone, and it will blow over.”
bal_31.
en_32. But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.
bal_32.
en_33. Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.
bal_33.
en_34. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him.
bal_34.
en_35. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.
bal_35.
en_36. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: “I do believe it is that Peter again!”
bal_36.
en_37. “Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”
bal_37.
en_38. “It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.
bal_38.
en_39. She was a tidy child.
bal_39.
en_40. She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.
bal_40.
en_41. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.
bal_41.
en_42. “What nonsense you talk, precious.
bal_42.
en_43. No one can get into the house without knocking.”
bal_43.
en_44. “I think he comes in by the window,” she said.
bal_44.
en_45. “My love, it is three floors up.”
bal_45.
en_46. “Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”
bal_46.
en_47. It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
bal_47.
en_48. Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.
bal_48.
en_49. “My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”
bal_49.
en_50. “I forgot,” said Wendy lightly.
bal_50.
en_51. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.
bal_51.
en_52. Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.
bal_52.
en_53. But, on the other hand, there were the leaves.
bal_53.
en_54. Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England.
bal_54.
en_55. She crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot.
bal_55.
en_56. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls.
bal_56.
en_57. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.
bal_57.
en_58. Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.
bal_58.
en_59. But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.
bal_59.
en_60. On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed.
bal_60.
en_61. It happened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.
bal_61.
en_62. All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
bal_62.
en_63. It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts.
bal_63.
en_64. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap.
bal_64.
en_65. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully.
bal_65.
en_66. She was asleep.
bal_66.
en_67. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire.
bal_67.
en_68. There should have been a fourth night-light.
bal_68.
en_69. While she slept she had a dream.
bal_69.
en_70. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it.
bal_70.
en_71. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children.
bal_71.
en_72. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.
bal_72.
en_73. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
bal_73.
en_74. The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.
bal_74.
en_75. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing
bal_75.
en_76. and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.
bal_76.
en_77. She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan.
bal_77.
en_78. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss.
bal_78.
en_79. He was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.
bal_79.
en_80. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.
bal_80.
en_81. Chapter II.
bal_81.
en_82. THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out.
bal_82.
en_83. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window.
bal_83.
en_84. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.
bal_84.
en_85. She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow.
bal_85.
en_86. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.
bal_86.
en_87. You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.
bal_87.
en_88. Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.
bal_88.
en_89. She hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”
bal_89.
en_90. But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house.
bal_90.
en_91. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.”
bal_91.
en_92. She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband.
bal_92.
en_93. Ah me!
bal_93.
en_94. The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.
bal_94.
en_95. Of course it was a Friday.
bal_95.
en_96. “I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her, holding her hand.
bal_96.
en_97. “No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all.
bal_97.
en_98. I, George Darling, did it.
bal_98.
en_99. _
bal_99.
en_100. Mea culpa, mea culpa_.”
bal_100.
en_101. He had had a classical education.
bal_101.
en_102. They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.
bal_102.
en_103. “If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs. Darling said.
bal_103.
en_104. “If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr. Darling.
bal_104.
en_105. “If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet eyes said.
bal_105.
en_106. “My liking for parties, George.”
bal_106.
en_107. “My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”
bal_107.
en_108. “My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”
bal_108.
en_109. Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse.”
bal_109.
en_110. Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana’s eyes.
bal_110.
en_111. “That fiend!”
bal_111.
en_112. Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.
bal_112.
en_113. They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening.
bal_113.
en_114. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.
bal_114.
en_115. “I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t.
bal_115.
en_116. Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet.
bal_116.
en_117. Oh dear,
bal_117.
en_118. oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana.
bal_118.
en_119. I tell you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”
bal_119.
en_120. Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown.
bal_120.
en_121. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her.
bal_121.
en_122. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it.
bal_122.
en_123. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.
bal_123.
en_124. She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying: “I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,” in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion.
bal_124.
en_125. Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.
bal_125.
en_126. Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
bal_126.
en_127. Michael had nearly cried.
bal_127.
en_128. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
bal_128.
en_129. “I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”
bal_129.
en_130. “Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.
bal_130.
en_131. “Boy.”
bal_131.
en_132. Then he had leapt into her arms.
bal_132.
en_133. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael’s last night in the nursery.
bal_133.
en_134. They go on with their recollections.
bal_134.
en_135. “It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?”
bal_135.
en_136. Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.
bal_136.
en_137. Perhaps there was some excuse for him.
bal_137.
en_138. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie.
bal_138.
en_139. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie.
bal_139.
en_140. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.
bal_140.
en_141. This was such an occasion.
bal_141.
en_142. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
bal_142.
en_143. “Why, what is the matter, father dear?”
bal_143.
en_144. “Matter!”
bal_144.
en_145. he yelled; he really yelled.
bal_145.
en_146. “This tie, it will not tie.”
bal_146.
en_147. He became dangerously sarcastic.
bal_147.
en_148. “Not round my neck!
bal_148.
en_149. Round the bed-post!
bal_149.
en_150. Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no!
bal_150.
en_151. Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”
bal_151.
en_152. He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.”
bal_152.
en_153. Even then Mrs. Darling was placid.
bal_153.
en_154. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate decided.
bal_154.
en_155. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.
bal_155.
en_156. “How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.
bal_156.
en_157. “Our last romp!”
bal_157.
en_158. Mr. Darling groaned.
bal_158.
en_159. “O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you get to know me, mother?’”
bal_159.
en_160. “I remember!”
bal_160.
en_161. “They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”
bal_161.
en_162. “And they were ours, ours!
bal_162.
en_163. and now they are gone.”
bal_163.
en_164. The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs.
bal_164.
en_165. They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming.
bal_165.
en_166. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.
bal_166.
en_167. “George, Nana is a treasure.”
bal_167.
en_168. “No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies.”
bal_168.
en_169. “Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”
bal_169.
en_170. “I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.”
bal_170.
en_171. It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy.
bal_171.
en_172. At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.
bal_172.
en_173. “It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does look a scoundrel.”
bal_173.
en_174. “We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when Nana came in with Michael’s medicine.
bal_174.
en_175. You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”
bal_175.
en_176. Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine.
bal_176.
en_177. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and
bal_177.
en_178. so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man, Michael.”
bal_178.
en_179. “Won’t; won’t!”
bal_179.
en_180. Michael cried naughtily.
bal_180.
en_181. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.
bal_181.
en_182. “Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her.
bal_182.
en_183. “Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur.
bal_183.
en_184. I said, ‘Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”
bal_184.
en_185. He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”
bal_185.
en_186. “Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”
bal_186.
en_187. He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there.
bal_187.
en_188. What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.
bal_188.
en_189. “I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of service.
bal_189.
en_190. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her.
bal_190.
en_191. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.
bal_191.
en_192. “John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff.
bal_192.
en_193. It’s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.”
bal_193.
en_194. “It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.
bal_194.
en_195. “I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.
bal_195.
en_196. “You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her.
bal_196.
en_197. “Michael first,” he said doggedly.
bal_197.
en_198. “Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.
bal_198.
en_199. “I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.
bal_199.
en_200. “Come on, father,” said John.
bal_200.
en_201. “Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.
bal_201.
en_202. Wendy was quite puzzled.
bal_202.
en_203. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”
bal_203.
en_204. “That is not the point,” he retorted.
bal_204.
en_205. “The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.”
bal_205.
en_206. His proud heart was nearly bursting.
bal_206.
en_207. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn’t fair.”
bal_207.
en_208. “Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.
bal_208.
en_209. “It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”
bal_209.
en_210. “Father’s a cowardly custard.”
bal_210.
en_211. “So are you a cowardly custard.”
bal_211.
en_212. “I’m not frightened.”
bal_212.
en_213. “Neither am I frightened.”
bal_213.
en_214. “Well, then, take it.”
bal_214.
en_215. “Well, then, you take it.”
bal_215.
en_216. Wendy had a splendid idea.
bal_216.
en_217. “Why not both take it at the same time?”
bal_217.
en_218. “Certainly,” said Mr. Darling.
bal_218.
en_219. “Are you ready, Michael?”
bal_219.
en_220. Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.
bal_220.
en_221. There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!”
bal_221.
en_222. Wendy exclaimed.
bal_222.
en_223. “What do you mean by ‘O father’?”
bal_223.
en_224. Mr. Darling demanded.
bal_224.
en_225. “Stop that row, Michael.
bal_225.
en_226. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it.”
bal_226.
en_227. It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did not admire him.
bal_227.
en_228. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom.
bal_228.
en_229. “I have just thought of a splendid joke.
bal_229.
en_230. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!”
bal_230.
en_231. It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana’s bowl.
bal_231.
en_232. “What fun!”
bal_232.
en_233. he said doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.
bal_233.
en_234. “Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into your bowl, Nana.”
bal_234.
en_235. Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it.
bal_235.
en_236. Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.
bal_236.
en_237. Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in.
bal_237.
en_238. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl.
bal_238.
en_239. “O George,” she said, “it’s your medicine!”
bal_239.
en_240. “It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy hugged Nana.
bal_240.
en_241. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”
bal_241.
en_242. And still Wendy hugged Nana.
bal_242.
en_243. “That’s right,” he shouted.
bal_243.
en_244. “Coddle her!
bal_244.
en_245. Nobody coddles me.
bal_245.
en_246. Oh dear no!
bal_246.
en_247. I am only the breadwinner, why should I be coddled—why, why, why!”
bal_247.
en_248. “George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will hear you.”
bal_248.
en_249. Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants.
bal_249.
en_250. “Let them!”
bal_250.
en_251. he answered recklessly.
bal_251.
en_252. “Bring in the whole world.
bal_252.
en_253. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”
bal_253.
en_254. The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back.
bal_254.
en_255. He felt he was a strong man again.
bal_255.
en_256. “In vain, in vain,” he cried; “the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up this instant.”
bal_256.
en_257. “George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you about that boy.”
bal_257.
en_258. Alas, he would not listen.
bal_258.
en_259. He was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the nursery.
bal_259.
en_260. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it.
bal_260.
en_261. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration.
bal_261.
en_262. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.
bal_262.
en_263. In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights.
bal_263.
en_264. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but Wendy was wiser.
bal_264.
en_265. “That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”
bal_265.
en_266. Danger!
bal_266.
en_267. “Are you sure, Wendy?”
bal_267.
en_268. “Oh, yes.”
bal_268.
en_269. Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window.
bal_269.
en_270. It was securely fastened.
bal_270.
en_271. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.
bal_271.
en_272. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her.
bal_272.
en_273. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”
bal_273.
en_274. Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”
bal_274.
en_275. “Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children.”
bal_275.
en_276. She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his arms round her.
bal_276.
en_277. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of you.”
bal_277.
en_278. They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.
bal_278.
en_279. No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes.
bal_279.
en_280. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them.
bal_280.
en_281. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever.
bal_281.
en_282. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was.
bal_282.
en_283. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder.
bal_283.
en_284. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way.
bal_284.
en_285. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out: “Now, Peter!”
bal_285.
en_286. Chapter III.
bal_286.
en_287. COME AWAY, COME AWAY!
bal_287.
en_288. For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly.
bal_288.
en_289. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.
bal_289.
en_290. There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out.
bal_290.
en_291. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing.
bal_291.
en_292. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage.
bal_292.
en_293. She was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_.
bal_293.
en_294. A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in.
bal_294.
en_295. He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.
bal_295.
en_296. “Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, “Tink, where are you?”
bal_296.
en_297. She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
bal_297.
en_298. “Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?”
bal_298.
en_299. The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him.
bal_299.
en_300. It is the fairy language.
bal_300.
en_301. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
bal_301.
en_302. Tink said that the shadow was in the big box.
bal_302.
en_303. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd.
bal_303.
en_304. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.
bal_304.
en_305. If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled.
bal_305.
en_306. He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed.
bal_306.
en_307. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.
bal_307.
en_308. His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed.
bal_308.
en_309. She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.
bal_309.
en_310. “Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”
bal_310.
en_311. Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully.
bal_311.
en_312. She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.
bal_312.
en_313. “What’s your name?” he asked.
bal_313.
en_314. “Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction.
bal_314.
en_315. “What is your name?”
bal_315.
en_316. “Peter Pan.”
bal_316.
en_317. She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively short name.
bal_317.
en_318. “Is that all?”
bal_318.
en_319. “Yes,” he said rather sharply.
bal_319.
en_320. He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name.
bal_320.
en_321. “I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.
bal_321.
en_322. “It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.
bal_322.
en_323. She asked where he lived.
bal_323.
en_324. “Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”
bal_324.
en_325. “What a funny address!”
bal_325.
en_326. Peter had a sinking.
bal_326.
en_327. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address.
bal_327.
en_328. “No, it isn’t,” he said.
bal_328.
en_329. “I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that what they put on the letters?”
bal_329.
en_330. He wished she had not mentioned letters.
bal_330.
en_331. “Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.
bal_331.
en_332. “But your mother gets letters?”
bal_332.
en_333. “Don’t have a mother,” he said.
bal_333.
en_334. Not only had he no mother, but he had not the slightest desire to have one.
bal_334.
en_335. He thought them very over-rated persons.
bal_335.
en_336. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy.
bal_336.
en_337. “O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and ran to him.
bal_337.
en_338. “I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly.
bal_338.
en_339. “I was crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on.
bal_339.
en_340. Besides, I wasn’t crying.”
bal_340.
en_341. “It has come off?”
bal_341.
en_342. “Yes.”
bal_342.
en_343. Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter.
bal_343.
en_344. “How awful!”
bal_344.
en_345. she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap.
bal_345.
en_346. How exactly like a boy!
bal_346.
en_347. Fortunately she knew at once what to do.
bal_347.
en_348. “It must be sewn on,” she said, just a little patronisingly.
bal_348.
en_349. “What’s sewn?” he asked.
bal_349.
en_350. “You’re dreadfully ignorant.”
bal_350.
en_351. “No, I’m not.”
bal_351.
en_352. But she was exulting in his ignorance.
bal_352.
en_353. “I shall sew it on for you, my little man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.
bal_353.
en_354. “I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.
bal_354.
en_355. “Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life.
bal_355.
en_356. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.
bal_356.
en_357. “Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee.
bal_357.
en_358. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy.
bal_358.
en_359. He thought he had attached the shadow himself.
bal_359.
en_360. “How clever I am!”
bal_360.
en_361. he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”
bal_361.
en_362. It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities.
bal_362.
en_363. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy.
bal_363.
en_364. But for the moment Wendy was shocked.
bal_364.
en_365. “You conceit,” she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”
bal_365.
en_366. “You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.
bal_366.
en_367. “A little!”
bal_367.
en_368. she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I can at least withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets.
bal_368.
en_369. To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.
bal_369.
en_370. “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw.
bal_370.
en_371. I can’t help crowing, Wendy, when I’m pleased with myself.”
bal_371.
en_372. Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly.
bal_372.
en_373. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.”
bal_373.
en_374. Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.
bal_374.
en_375. “Do you really think so, Peter?”
bal_375.
en_376. “Yes, I do.”
bal_376.
en_377. “I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up again,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed.
bal_377.
en_378. She also said
bal_378.
en_379. she would
bal_379.

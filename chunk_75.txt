en_1. I don’t suppose these fellows carry guns--would undo all our plans.
bal_1.
en_2. There must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.”
bal_2.
en_3. He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.
bal_3.
en_4. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.
bal_4.
en_5. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire.
bal_5.
en_6. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?)
bal_6.
en_7. He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:-- “Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.
bal_7.
en_8. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has wrought such woe to you and yours.
bal_8.
en_9. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may.
bal_9.
en_10. I am old.
bal_10.
en_11. My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.
bal_11.
en_12. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way.
bal_12.
en_13. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men.
bal_13.
en_14. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s country.
bal_14.
en_15. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula.
bal_15.
en_16. Here, Madam Mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.
bal_16.
en_17. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.”
bal_17.
en_18. Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:-- “Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right into the jaws of his death-trap?
bal_18.
en_19. Not for the world!
bal_19.
en_20. Not for Heaven or Hell!”
bal_20.
en_21. He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:-- “Do you know what the place is?
bal_21.
en_22. Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
bal_22.
en_23. Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?”
bal_23.
en_24. Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry: “Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!”
bal_24.
en_25. and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.
bal_25.
en_26. The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:--
bal_26.
en_27. “Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go.
bal_27.
en_28. God forbid that I should take her into that place.
bal_28.
en_29. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not see.
bal_29.
en_30. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify.
bal_30.
en_31. Remember that we are in terrible straits.
bal_31.
en_32. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw.
bal_32.
en_33. You have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them.
bal_33.
en_34. You shudder; and well may it be.
bal_34.
en_35. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.
bal_35.
en_36. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving, possibly my life?
bal_36.
en_37. If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company.”
bal_37.
en_38. “Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “we are in the hands of God!”
bal_38.

en_42. Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
bal_42.
en_43. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave!
bal_43.
en_44. And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
bal_44.
en_45. What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used.
bal_45.
en_46. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.
bal_46.
en_47. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour.
bal_47.
en_48. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice.
bal_48.
en_49. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed.
bal_49.
en_50. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.
bal_50.
en_51. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.
bal_51.
en_52. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses.
bal_52.
en_53. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter.
bal_53.
en_54. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right.
bal_54.
en_55. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest.
bal_55.
en_56. Alas!
bal_56.
en_57. I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that.
bal_57.
en_58. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.

bal_69.
en_70. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up.
bal_70.
en_71. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.
bal_71.
en_72. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one.
bal_72.
en_73. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians.
bal_73.
en_74. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.
bal_74.
en_75. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch.
bal_75.
en_76. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place....
bal_76.
en_77. My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.
bal_77.
en_78. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble.
bal_78.
en_79. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves.
bal_79.
en_80. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity.
bal_80.
en_81. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses.
bal_81.
en_82. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party.
bal_82.
en_83. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.
bal_83.
en_84. It is a wild adventure we are on.
bal_84.
en_85. Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home.
bal_85.
en_86. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things.

en_93. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.
bal_93.
en_94. As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek.

bal_100.
en_101. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone.
bal_101.
en_102. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little.
bal_102.
en_103. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly.
bal_103.
en_104. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.
bal_104.
en_105. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do.
bal_105.
en_106. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board.
bal_106.
en_107. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth.
bal_107.
en_108. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night.
bal_108.
en_109. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time.
bal_109.

bal_116.
en_117. That good fellow would not wake me.
bal_117.
en_118. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble.
bal_118.
en_119. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right.
bal_119.
en_120. I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch.
bal_120.
en_121. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me.
bal_121.
en_122. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing.
bal_122.
en_123. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.
bal_123.
en_124. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass.
bal_124.
en_125. God guide and help them!
bal_125.
en_126. I am afraid to think what may happen.

bal_128.
en_129. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on.
bal_129.
en_130. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have met much obstruction.
bal_130.
en_131. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.

bal_149.
en_150. Some went up only a few hours before.
bal_150.
en_151. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again.
bal_151.
en_152. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh.
bal_152.

bal_180.
en_181. November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.
bal_181.
en_182. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed.
bal_182.
en_183. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one.
bal_183.
en_184. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses.
bal_184.
en_185. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go.
bal_185.
en_186. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.
bal_186.
en_187. They are _very, very_ superstitious.
bal_187.
en_188. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.
bal_188.
en_189. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic.
bal_189.
en_190. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions.
bal_190.
en_191. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way.
bal_191.
en_192. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell.
bal_192.
en_193. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking wood”; so our enemy is still on the river.
bal_193.

en_216. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves.
bal_216.
en_217. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.
bal_217.
en_218. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change.
bal_218.
en_219. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand.
bal_219.
en_220. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble.
bal_220.
en_221. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive.

en_241. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
bal_241.
en_242. However, to-night she is more _vif_.
bal_242.
en_243. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever.
bal_243.
en_244. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas!
bal_244.
en_245. with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether.
bal_245.
en_246. Well, God’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!
bal_246.
en_247. Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.
bal_247.
en_248. We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning.
bal_248.
en_249. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism.
bal_249.
en_250. We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance.
bal_250.
en_251. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep.
bal_251.
en_252. As before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.”
bal_252.
en_253. Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
bal_253.
en_254. At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:-- “This is the way.”
bal_254.
en_255. “How know you it?” I ask.
bal_255.
en_256. “Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”
bal_256.
en_257. At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such by-road.
bal_257.
en_258. It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.
bal_258.
en_259. So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen--the horses know and they only.
bal_259.
en_260. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.
bal_260.
en_261. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him.
bal_261.
en_262. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.
bal_262.
en_263. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed.
bal_263.
en_264. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.
bal_264.
en_265. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.
bal_265.
en_266. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her.
bal_266.
en_267. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever.
bal_267.
en_268. I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep.
bal_268.
en_269. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
bal_269.
en_270. For we are going up, and up; and all is oh!
bal_270.
en_271. so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.
bal_271.
en_272. Then I arouse Madam Mina.
bal_272.
en_273. This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.
bal_273.
en_274. But she sleep not, being as though I were not.
bal_274.
en_275. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
bal_275.
en_276. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her.
bal_276.
en_277. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count’s house.
bal_277.
en_278. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear.
bal_278.
en_279. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed.
bal_279.
en_280. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready.
bal_280.
en_281. I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that she was so hungry that she would not wait.
bal_281.
en_282. I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it.
bal_282.
en_283. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.
bal_283.
en_284. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes.
bal_284.
en_285. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning.
bal_285.
en_286. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas!
bal_286.
en_287. though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep.
bal_287.
en_288. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake.
bal_288.
en_289. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready.
bal_289.
en_290. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before.
bal_290.
en_291. And I like it not.
bal_291.
en_292. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even to think but I must go on my way.
bal_292.
en_293. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.

en_297. _5
bal_297.
en_298. November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
bal_298.
en_299. All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land.
bal_299.
en_300. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.
bal_300.
en_301. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food.
bal_301.
en_302. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism.
bal_302.
en_303. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.”
bal_303.
en_304. As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept.
bal_304.
en_305. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.
bal_305.
en_306. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary.
bal_306.
en_307. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.
bal_307.
en_308. I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
bal_308.
en_309. unavailing till too late.
bal_309.
en_310. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could.
bal_310.
en_311. Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs.
bal_311.
en_312. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger.
bal_312.
en_313. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness.
bal_313.
en_314. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all.
bal_314.
en_315. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded.
bal_315.
en_316. She sat still all the time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said.
bal_316.
en_317. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel.
bal_317.
en_318. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:-- “Will you not come over to the fire?”
bal_318.
en_319. for I wished to make a test of what she could.
bal_319.
en_320. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.
bal_320.
en_321. “Why not go on?”
bal_321.
en_322. I asked.
bal_322.
en_323. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place.
bal_323.
en_324. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:-- “I cannot!” and remained silent.
bal_324.
en_325. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could.
bal_325.
en_326. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!
bal_326.
en_327. Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them.
bal_327.
en_328. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time.
bal_328.
en_329. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them.
bal_329.
en_330. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.
bal_330.
en_331. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments.
bal_331.
en_332. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst.
bal_332.
en_333. I began to fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood.
bal_333.
en_334. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety.
bal_334.
en_335. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him.
bal_335.
en_336. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain.
bal_336.
en_337. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away.
bal_337.
en_338. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round.
bal_338.
en_339. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:-- “No!
bal_339.
en_340. No! Do not go without.
bal_340.
en_341. Here you are safe!”
bal_341.
en_342. I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:-- “But you?
bal_342.
en_343. It is for you that I fear!”
bal_343.
en_344. whereat she laughed--a laugh, low and unreal, and said:-- “Fear for _me_!
bal_344.
en_345. Why fear for me?
bal_345.
en_346. None safer in all the world from them than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
bal_346.
en_347. Then, alas!
bal_347.
en_348. I knew.
bal_348.
en_349. Did I not,
bal_349.

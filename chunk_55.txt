en_59. On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship.
bal_59.
en_60. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear.
bal_60.
en_61. He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
bal_61.
en_62. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread.

bal_67.
en_68. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike.
bal_68.
en_69. I let him take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched.
bal_69.
en_70. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide.
bal_70.

en_136. Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out.
bal_136.
en_137. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.

en_142. I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there.
bal_142.
en_143. The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing.
bal_143.
en_144. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.
bal_144.
en_145. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels.
bal_145.
en_146. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way.
bal_146.
en_147. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_It_ is here; I know it, now.
bal_147.
en_148. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale.
bal_148.
en_149. It was in the bows, and looking out.
bal_149.
en_150. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.”
bal_150.
en_151. And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space.
bal_151.
en_152. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It.
bal_152.
en_153. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes.
bal_153.
en_154. I’ll unscrew them one by one and see.
bal_154.
en_155. You work the helm.”
bal_155.
en_156. And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below.
bal_156.
en_157. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm.
bal_157.
en_158. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway.
bal_158.
en_159. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him.
bal_159.
en_160. He can’t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do.
bal_160.
en_161. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes.
bal_161.
en_162. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
bal_162.
en_163. Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....

bal_166.
en_167. It is nearly all over now.
bal_167.
en_168. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear.
bal_168.
en_169. “Save me!
bal_169.
en_170. save me!”
bal_170.
en_171. he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog.
bal_171.
en_172. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is too late. _
bal_172.
en_173. He_ is there.
bal_173.
en_174. I know the secret now.
bal_174.
en_175. The sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left!”
bal_175.
en_176. Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea.
bal_176.
en_177. I suppose I know the secret too, now.
bal_177.
en_178. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself.
bal_178.

en_188. I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not.
bal_188.
en_189. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw It--Him!
bal_189.
en_190. God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard.
bal_190.
en_191. It was better to die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object.
bal_191.
en_192. But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship.
bal_192.
en_193. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain.
bal_193.
en_194. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on.
bal_194.
en_195. If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act....

bal_201.
en_202. There is no evidence to adduce; and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say.
bal_202.
en_203. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral.
bal_203.
en_204. Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.
bal_204.
en_205. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave.
bal_205.
en_206. No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town.

en_209. 8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep.
bal_209.
en_210. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, it made me shudder.
bal_210.
en_211. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun.
bal_211.
en_212. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself.
bal_212.
en_213. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.
bal_213.
en_214. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life.
bal_214.
en_215. Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.
bal_215.
en_216. There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd.

bal_226.
en_227. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.
bal_227.
en_228. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again.
bal_228.
en_229. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
bal_229.
en_230. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything.
bal_230.
en_231. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
bal_231.
en_232. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her.
bal_232.
en_233. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself.
bal_233.
en_234. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken.
bal_234.
en_235. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder.
bal_235.
en_236. Poor dear old man!
bal_236.
en_237. Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes!
bal_237.
en_238. Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do.
bal_238.
en_239. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals.
bal_239.
en_240. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
bal_240.
en_241. The dog is always with him.
bal_241.
en_242. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.
bal_242.
en_243. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling.
bal_243.
en_244. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise.
bal_244.
en_245. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path.
bal_245.
en_246. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed.
bal_246.
en_247. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble.
bal_247.
en_248. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it.
bal_248.
en_249. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.
bal_249.
en_250. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble.
bal_250.
en_251. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure.
bal_251.
en_252. The whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all afford material for her dreams.
bal_252.
en_253. I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and back.
bal_253.
en_254. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.

en_258. We had a lovely walk.
bal_258.
en_259. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.
bal_259.
en_260. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start.
bal_260.
en_261. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand.
bal_261.
en_262. I believe we should have shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites.
bal_262.
en_263. Men are more tolerant, bless them!

en_264. Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls.
bal_264.
en_265. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
bal_265.
en_266. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper.
bal_266.
en_267. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic.
bal_267.
en_268. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired.

en_271. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
bal_271.
en_272. Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting.
bal_272.
en_273. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself.
bal_273.
en_274. And a nice job she will make of it, too!
bal_274.
en_275. There’s some consolation in that.
bal_275.
en_276. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better.
bal_276.
en_277. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming.
bal_277.
en_278. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan....
bal_278.
en_279. God bless and keep him.

en_284. August, 3 a. m._--Diary again.
bal_284.
en_285. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
bal_285.
en_286. I am too agitated to sleep.
bal_286.
en_287. We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience.
bal_287.
en_288. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
bal_288.
en_289. Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me.
bal_289.
en_290. The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her.
bal_290.
en_291. The bed was empty.
bal_291.
en_292. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room.
bal_292.
en_293. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it.
bal_293.
en_294. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her.
bal_294.
en_295. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention.
bal_295.
en_296. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
bal_296.
en_297. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places.
bal_297.
en_298. “Thank God,” I said to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.”
bal_298.
en_299. I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room.
bal_299.
en_300. Not there!
bal_300.
en_301. Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart.
bal_301.
en_302. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open.
bal_302.
en_303. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught.
bal_303.
en_304. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was.
bal_304.
en_305. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details.
bal_305.
en_306. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.
bal_306.
en_307. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight.
bal_307.
en_308. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected.
bal_308.
en_309. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat.
bal_309.
en_310. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across.
bal_310.
en_311. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all around it.
bal_311.
en_312. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible.
bal_312.
en_313. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.
bal_313.
en_314. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it.
bal_314.
en_315. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff.
bal_315.
en_316. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition.
bal_316.
en_317. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey.
bal_317.
en_318. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty.
bal_318.
en_319. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow.
bal_319.
en_320. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure.
bal_320.
en_321. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!”
bal_321.
en_322. and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes.
bal_322.
en_323. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard.
bal_323.
en_324. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute
bal_324.
en_325. or so I lost sight of her.
bal_325.
en_326. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat.
bal_326.
en_327. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.
bal_327.
en_328. When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.
bal_328.
en_329. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath.
bal_329.
en_330. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat.
bal_330.
en_331. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold.
bal_331.
en_332. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was.
bal_332.
en_333. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned.
bal_333.
en_334. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her.
bal_334.
en_335. At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally.
bal_335.
en_336. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke.
bal_336.
en_337. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
bal_337.
en_338. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.
bal_338.
en_339. She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.
bal_339.
en_340. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.
bal_340.
en_341. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
bal_341.
en_342. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
bal_342.
en_343. Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.
bal_343.
en_344. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in Scotland.
bal_344.
en_345. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint.
bal_345.
en_346. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind.
bal_346.
en_347. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.
bal_347.
en_348. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.
bal_348.
en_349. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay, infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so.
bal_349.
en_350. I hope I did right.
bal_350.
en_351. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.
bal_351.
en_352. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....

en_357. Same day, noon._--All goes well.
bal_357.
en_358. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side.
bal_358.
en_359. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks.
bal_359.
en_360. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.
bal_360.
en_361. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.
bal_361.
en_362. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood.
bal_362.
en_363. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.
bal_363.
en_364. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.

en_369. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze.
bal_369.
en_370. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate.
bal_370.
en_371. I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me.
bal_371.
en_372. But there!
bal_372.
en_373. I must only be patient.
bal_373.
en_374. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.
bal_374.
en_375. Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.
bal_375.
en_376. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.

bal_379.
en_380. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest.
bal_380.
en_381. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window.
bal_381.
en_382. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning.
bal_382.
en_383. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.
bal_383.
en_384. I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.
bal_384.
en_385. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.

bal_390.
en_391. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.
bal_391.
en_392. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out.
bal_392.
en_393. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great, silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words.
bal_393.
en_394. Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles.
bal_394.
en_395. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey.
bal_395.
en_396. When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
bal_396.
en_397. She did not stir again all night.

en_401. _14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.
bal_401.
en_402. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner.
bal_402.
en_403. This afternoon she made a funny remark.
bal_403.
en_404. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do.
bal_404.
en_405. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.
bal_405.
en_406. We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:-- “His red eyes again!
bal_406.
en_407. They are just the same.”
bal_407.
en_408. It was such an odd expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me.
bal_408.
en_409. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes.
bal_409.
en_410. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone.
bal_410.
en_411. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion.
bal_411.
en_412. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved.
bal_412.
en_413. I called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with
bal_413.

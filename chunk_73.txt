en_1. your safety is our solemnest duty.
bal_1.
en_2. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.”
bal_2.
en_3. He paused, embarrassed.
bal_3.
en_4. As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:-- “I know.
bal_4.
en_5. That is why I must go.
bal_5.
en_6. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again.
bal_6.
en_7. I know that when the Count wills me I must go.
bal_7.
en_8. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.”
bal_8.
en_9. God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour.
bal_9.
en_10. I could only clasp her hand.
bal_10.
en_11. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears.
bal_11.
en_12. She went on:-- “You men are brave and strong.
bal_12.
en_13. You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.
bal_13.
en_14. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know.”
bal_14.
en_15. Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:-- “Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise.
bal_15.
en_16. You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.”
bal_16.
en_17. When he had spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her.
bal_17.
en_18. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room.
bal_18.
en_19. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly.
bal_19.
en_20. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
bal_20.
en_21. He told them what Mina had said, and went on:-- “In the morning we shall leave for Varna.
bal_21.
en_22. We have now to deal with a new factor: Madam Mina.
bal_22.
en_23. Oh, but her soul is true.
bal_23.
en_24. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are warned in time.
bal_24.
en_25. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”
bal_25.
en_26. “What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically.
bal_26.
en_27. The Professor paused before replying:-- “We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it.
bal_27.
en_28. This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the superstition.
bal_28.
en_29. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still.
bal_29.
en_30. Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and--and all will be well.”
bal_30.
en_31. “I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris.
bal_31.
en_32. “When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!”
bal_32.
en_33. I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
bal_33.
en_34. I think he understood my look; I hope he did.
bal_34.
en_35. “Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing.
bal_35.
en_36. “Brave boy.
bal_36.
en_37. Quincey is all man.
bal_37.
en_38. God bless him for it.
bal_38.
en_39. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear.
bal_39.
en_40. I do but say what we may do--what we must do.
bal_40.
en_41. But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do.
bal_41.
en_42. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say.
bal_42.
en_43. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack.
bal_43.
en_44. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order.
bal_44.
en_45. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be.
bal_45.
en_46. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel.
bal_46.
en_47. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.”
bal_47.
en_48. There was nothing further to be said, and we parted.
bal_48.
en_49. I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....

en_53. _Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete.
bal_53.
en_54. Mina if she survive is my sole heir.
bal_54.
en_55. If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.
bal_55.
en_56. It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’s uneasiness calls my attention to it.
bal_56.
en_57. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal.
bal_57.
en_58. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God’s will be means to a good end.
bal_58.
en_59. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.
bal_59.
en_60. She is calling to me.
bal_60.
en_61. CHAPTER XXV DR. SEWARD’S DIARY _11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.
bal_61.
en_62. I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
bal_62.
en_63. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action.
bal_63.
en_64. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon.
bal_64.
en_65. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.
bal_65.
en_66. To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle.
bal_66.
en_67. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so.
bal_67.
en_68. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close.
bal_68.
en_69. Taking her husband’s hand in hers began:-- “We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time!
bal_69.
en_70. I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.”
bal_70.
en_71. This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers.
bal_71.
en_72. “In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.
bal_72.
en_73. You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you.
bal_73.
en_74. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake--you will do.
bal_74.
en_75. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
bal_75.
en_76. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us.
bal_76.
en_77. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way out for me, you must not
bal_77.
en_78. and I must not take it!”
bal_78.
en_79. She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.
bal_79.
en_80. “What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.
bal_80.
en_81. “What is that way, which we must not--may not--take?”
bal_81.
en_82. “That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.
bal_82.
en_83. I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy’s.
bal_83.
en_84. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me.
bal_84.
en_85. But death is not all.
bal_85.
en_86. I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God’s will.
bal_86.
en_87. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!”
bal_87.
en_88. We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude.
bal_88.
en_89. The faces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming.
bal_89.
en_90. She continued:-- “This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.”
bal_90.
en_91. I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness.
bal_91.
en_92. “What will each of you give?
bal_92.
en_93. Your lives I know,” she went on quickly, “that is easy for brave men.
bal_93.
en_94. Your lives are God’s, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?”
bal_94.
en_95. She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face.
bal_95.
en_96. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up.
bal_96.
en_97. “Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now.
bal_97.
en_98. You must promise me, one and all--even you, my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”
bal_98.
en_99. “What is that time?”
bal_99.
en_100. The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low and strained.
bal_100.
en_101. “When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die than I may live.
bal_101.
en_102. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”
bal_102.
en_103. Quincey was the first to rise after the pause.
bal_103.
en_104. He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:-- “I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.
bal_104.
en_105. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!”
bal_105.
en_106. “My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.
bal_106.
en_107. “I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.
bal_107.
en_108. “And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath.
bal_108.
en_109. I followed, myself.
bal_109.
en_110. Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked:-- “And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”
bal_110.
en_111. “You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes.
bal_111.
en_112. “You must not shrink.
bal_112.
en_113. You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time.
bal_113.
en_114. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy.
bal_114.
en_115. Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them.
bal_115.
en_116. It is men’s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial!
bal_116.
en_117. And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best.
bal_117.
en_118. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best right to give her peace.
bal_118.
en_119. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.”
bal_119.
en_120. “Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice.
bal_120.
en_121. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said:-- “And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget: this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.
bal_121.
en_122. At such a time I myself might be--nay!
bal_122.
en_123. if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued with your enemy against you.”
bal_123.
en_124. “One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will.”
bal_124.
en_125. We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to speak:-- “I want you to read the Burial Service.”
bal_125.
en_126. She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day.
bal_126.
en_127. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us.
bal_127.
en_128. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”
bal_128.
en_129. “But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”
bal_129.
en_130. “Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand.
bal_130.
en_131. “I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
bal_131.
en_132. “Oh, my wife, must I read it?”
bal_132.
en_133. he said, before he began.
bal_133.
en_134. “It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.
bal_134.
en_135. “How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness.
bal_135.
en_136. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead.
bal_136.
en_137. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”

en_141. She was right in her instinct.
bal_141.
en_142. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.

bal_145.
en_146. October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express.
bal_146.
en_147. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o’clock.
bal_147.
en_148. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the Odessus.”
bal_148.
en_149. The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them.
bal_149.
en_150. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
bal_150.
en_151. Thank God!
bal_151.
en_152. Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back.
bal_152.
en_153. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time.
bal_153.
en_154. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times.
bal_154.
en_155. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed.
bal_155.
en_156. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him.
bal_156.
en_157. He always asks her what she can see and hear.
bal_157.
en_158. She answers to the first:-- “Nothing; all is dark.”
bal_158.
en_159. And to the second:-- “I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by.
bal_159.
en_160. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak.
bal_160.
en_161. The wind is high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”
bal_161.
en_162. It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna.
bal_162.
en_163. Lord Godalming has just returned.
bal_163.
en_164. He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd’s from anywhere.
bal_164.
en_165. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.
bal_165.
en_166. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.
bal_166.
en_167. We had dinner and went to bed early.
bal_167.
en_168. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives.
bal_168.
en_169. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset.
bal_169.
en_170. The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship.
bal_170.
en_171. As he dare not change to man’s form without suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the box.
bal_171.
en_172. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes.
bal_172.
en_173. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much.
bal_173.
en_174. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen.
bal_174.
en_175. Thank God!
bal_175.
en_176. this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.
bal_176.
en_177. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe.
bal_177.
en_178. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!

en_183. As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.

en_186. * * _17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour.
bal_186.
en_187. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.
bal_187.
en_188. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna.
bal_188.
en_189. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done.
bal_189.
en_190. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.
bal_190.
en_191. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart.
bal_191.
en_192. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready.
bal_192.
en_193. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body, it will soon after fall into dust.
bal_193.
en_194. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused.
bal_194.
en_195. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope.
bal_195.
en_196. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come.
bal_196.
en_197. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent.
bal_197.
en_198. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the _Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.

bal_210.
en_211. To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must.
bal_211.
en_212. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s.
bal_212.
en_213. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard.
bal_213.
en_214. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.
bal_214.
en_215. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence.
bal_215.
en_216. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks.
bal_216.
en_217. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.
bal_217.
en_218. We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others.
bal_218.
en_219. It would break poor Harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject.
bal_219.
en_220. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her.
bal_220.
en_221. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!...
bal_221.
en_222. We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other.
bal_222.
en_223. We should neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
bal_223.
en_224. “Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word!
bal_224.
en_225. I am grateful to whoever invented it.
bal_225.
en_226. It is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London.
bal_226.
en_227. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early.
bal_227.
en_228. We shall get up at one o’clock, so as to be ready.

en_233. October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship’s arrival.
bal_233.
en_234. Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.
bal_234.
en_235. We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him.
bal_235.
en_236. It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!
bal_236.
en_237. Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day.
bal_237.
en_238. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it.
bal_238.
en_239. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping.
bal_239.
en_240. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.
bal_240.
en_241. She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else.
bal_241.
en_242. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.

en_246. Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days.
bal_246.
en_247. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.
bal_247.
en_248. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination.
bal_248.
en_249. To his doom, I trust!

bal_254.
en_255. She ought to be here by now.
bal_255.
en_256. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is apparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same.
bal_256.
en_257. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port.
bal_257.
en_258. We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.

en_263. October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
bal_263.
en_264. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very faint.”
bal_264.
en_265. The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further report.”
bal_265.
en_266. Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us.
bal_266.
en_267. He added significantly:-- “I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s.
bal_267.
en_268. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.”
bal_268.
en_269. I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand.
bal_269.
en_270. We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.

bal_274.
en_275. Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._
bal_275.
en_276. “_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o’clock to-day.”
bal_276.
en_277. _Dr. Seward’s Diary._ _
bal_277.
en_278. 28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected.
bal_278.
en_279. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
bal_279.
en_280. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur.
bal_280.
en_281. None the less, however, was it a surprise.
bal_281.
en_282. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be.
bal_282.
en_283. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man.
bal_283.
en_284. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently.
bal_284.
en_285. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.
bal_285.
en_286. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.
bal_286.
en_287. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another.
bal_287.
en_288. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant “action.”
bal_288.
en_289. Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer.
bal_289.
en_290. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there.
bal_290.
en_291. “When does the next train start for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.
bal_291.
en_292. “At 6:30 to-morrow morning!”
bal_292.
en_293. We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.
bal_293.
en_294. “How on earth do you know?” said Art.
bal_294.
en_295. “You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend.
bal_295.
en_296. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my husband.
bal_296.
en_297. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time-tables now.
bal_297.
en_298. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully.
bal_298.
en_299. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”
bal_299.
en_300. “Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.
bal_300.
en_301. “Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming.
bal_301.
en_302. Van Helsing shook his head: “I fear not.
bal_302.
en_303. This land is very different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train.
bal_303.
en_304. Moreover, we have something to prepare.
bal_304.
en_305. We must think.
bal_305.
en_306. Now let us organize.
bal_306.
en_307. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.
bal_307.
en_308. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here.
bal_308.
en_309. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube.
bal_309.
en_310. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.
bal_310.
en_311. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.”
bal_311.
en_312. “And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do.
bal_312.
en_313. Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”
bal_313.
en_314. The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance.
bal_314.
en_315. We said nothing at the time, however.
bal_315.
en_316. When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker’s journal at the Castle.
bal_316.
en_317. She went away to get it; when the door was shut upon her he said to me:-- “We mean the same!
bal_317.
en_318. speak out!”
bal_318.
en_319. “There is some change.
bal_319.
en_320. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us.”
bal_320.
en_321. “Quite so.
bal_321.
en_322. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”
bal_322.
en_323. “No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”
bal_323.
en_324. “You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.
bal_324.
en_325. I want to tell you something.
bal_325.
en_326. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk; but I believe it is right.
bal_326.
en_327. In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me.
bal_327.
en_328. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.
bal_328.
en_329. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
bal_329.
en_330. Now he make his most effort to escape us.
bal_330.
en_331. At present he want her not.
bal_331.
en_332. “He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call; but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him.
bal_332.
en_333. Ah!
bal_333.
en_334. there I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small.
bal_334.
en_335. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
bal_335.
en_336. She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether--though he think not so.
bal_336.
en_337. Hush!
bal_337.
en_338. let me speak, and you shall learn.
bal_338.
en_339. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits.
bal_339.
en_340. I fear, as I never feared before.
bal_340.
en_341. We can only trust the good God.
bal_341.
en_342. Silence!
bal_342.
en_343. here she comes!”
bal_343.
en_344. I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery.
bal_344.
en_345. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.
bal_345.
en_346. He looked

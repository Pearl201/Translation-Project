en_1. after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.
bal_1.
en_2. I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.
bal_2.
en_3. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.
bal_3.
en_4. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.
bal_4.
en_5. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
bal_5.
en_6. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
bal_6.
en_7. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
bal_7.
en_8. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.
bal_8.
en_9. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.
bal_9.
en_10. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
bal_10.
en_11. Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.
bal_11.
en_12. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.
bal_12.
en_13. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
bal_13.
en_14. Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.
bal_14.
en_15. This professor was very unlike his colleague.
bal_15.
en_16. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.
bal_16.
en_17. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
bal_17.
en_18. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
bal_18.
en_19. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.
bal_19.
en_20. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing.
bal_20.
en_21. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.
bal_21.
en_22. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.
bal_22.
en_23. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.
bal_23.
en_24. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”
bal_24.
en_25. Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me.
bal_25.
en_26. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.
bal_26.
en_27. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
bal_27.
en_28. I closed not my eyes that night.
bal_28.
en_29. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.
bal_29.
en_30. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came.
bal_30.
en_31. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.
bal_31.
en_32. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.
bal_32.
en_33. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.
bal_33.
en_34. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
bal_34.
en_35. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.
bal_35.
en_36. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.
bal_36.
en_37. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.
bal_37.
en_38. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
bal_38.
en_39. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”
bal_39.
en_40. I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed)
bal_40.
en_41. any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.
bal_41.
en_42. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
bal_42.
en_43. “I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.
bal_43.
en_44. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.
bal_44.
en_45. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.
bal_45.
en_46. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”
bal_46.
en_47. He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.
bal_47.
en_48. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
bal_48.
en_49. Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
bal_49.
en_50. Chapter 4 From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
bal_50.
en_51. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.
bal_51.
en_52. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.
bal_52.
en_53. In M. Waldman I found a true friend.
bal_53.
en_54. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.
bal_54.
en_55. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
bal_55.
en_56. My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
bal_56.
en_57. As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.
bal_57.
en_58. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.
bal_58.
en_59. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
bal_59.
en_60. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.
bal_60.
en_61. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
bal_61.
en_62. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
bal_62.
en_63. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.
bal_63.
en_64. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.
bal_64.
en_65. One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.
bal_65.
en_66. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
bal_66.
en_67. It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.
bal_67.
en_68. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.
bal_68.
en_69. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.
bal_69.
en_70. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.
bal_70.
en_71. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
bal_71.
en_72. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.
bal_72.
en_73. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.
bal_73.
en_74. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.
bal_74.
en_75. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.
bal_75.
en_76. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.
bal_76.
en_77. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.
bal_77.
en_78. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.
bal_78.
en_79. Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.
bal_79.
en_80. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.
bal_80.
en_81. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.
bal_81.
en_82. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
bal_82.
en_83. The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.
bal_83.
en_84. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.
bal_84.
en_85. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
bal_85.
en_86. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.
bal_86.
en_87. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.
bal_87.
en_88. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.
bal_88.
en_89. I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.
bal_89.
en_90. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.
bal_90.
en_91. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
bal_91.
en_92. When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
bal_92.
en_93. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.
bal_93.
en_94. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.
bal_94.
en_95. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.
bal_95.
en_96. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.
bal_96.
en_97. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
bal_97.
en_98. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.
bal_98.
en_99. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.
bal_99.
en_100. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
bal_100.
en_101. No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.
bal_101.
en_102. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.
bal_102.
en_103. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
bal_103.
en_104. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.
bal_104.
en_105. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
bal_105.
en_106. These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.
bal_106.
en_107. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.
bal_107.
en_108. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.
bal_108.
en_109. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.
bal_109.
en_110. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
bal_110.
en_111. My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.
bal_111.
en_112. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.
bal_112.
en_113. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.
bal_113.
en_114. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.
bal_114.
en_115. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.
bal_115.
en_116. The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.
bal_116.
en_117. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.
bal_117.
en_118. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.
bal_118.
en_119. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.
bal_119.
en_120. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.”
bal_120.
en_121. I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.
bal_121.
en_122. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.
bal_122.
en_123. I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.
bal_123.
en_124. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
bal_124.
en_125. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
bal_125.
en_126. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.
bal_126.
en_127. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
bal_127.
en_128. But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
bal_128.
en_129. My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
bal_129.
en_130. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.
bal_130.
en_131. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.
bal_131.
en_132. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
bal_132.
en_133. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.
bal_133.
en_134. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.
bal_134.
en_135. Chapter 5
bal_135.
en_136. It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
bal_136.
en_137. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.
bal_137.
en_138. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
bal_138.
en_139. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?
bal_139.
en_140. His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.
bal_140.
en_141. Beautiful!
bal_141.
en_142. Great God!
bal_142.
en_143. His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
bal_143.
en_144. The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
bal_144.
en_145. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.
bal_145.
en_146. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.
bal_146.
en_147. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
bal_147.
en_148. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.
bal_148.
en_149. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
bal_149.
en_150. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.
bal_150.
en_151. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.
bal_151.
en_152. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
bal_152.
en_153. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created.
bal_153.
en_154. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.
bal_154.
en_155. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.
bal_155.
en_156. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.
bal_156.
en_157. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.
bal_157.
en_158. Oh!
bal_158.
en_159. No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.
bal_159.
en_160. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.
bal_160.
en_161. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.
bal_161.
en_162. I passed the night wretchedly.
bal_162.
en_163. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.
bal_163.
en_164. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
bal_164.
en_165. Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.
bal_165.
en_166. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.
bal_166.
en_167. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
bal_167.
en_168. I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.
bal_168.
en_169. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.
bal_169.
en_170. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.
bal_170.
en_171. [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]
bal_171.
en_172. Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.
bal_172.
en_173. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.
bal_173.
en_174. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.
bal_174.
en_175. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you!
bal_175.
en_176. How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!”
bal_176.
en_177. Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
bal_177.
en_178. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.
bal_178.
en_179. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.
bal_179.
en_180. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.
bal_180.
en_181. “You may easily believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’
bal_181.
en_182. But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”
bal_182.
en_183. “It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”
bal_183.
en_184. “Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.
bal_184.
en_185. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.
bal_185.
en_186. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.”
bal_186.
en_187. “You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.”
bal_187.
en_188. I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.
bal_188.
en_189. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.
bal_189.
en_190. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.
bal_190.
en_191. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
bal_191.
en_192. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.
bal_192.
en_193. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.
bal_193.
en_194. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.
bal_194.
en_195. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.
bal_195.
en_196. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.
bal_196.
en_197. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.
bal_197.
en_198. We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.
bal_198.
en_199. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.
bal_199.
en_200. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
bal_200.
en_201. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.
bal_201.
en_202. “My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter?
bal_202.
en_203. Do not laugh in that manner.
bal_203.
en_204. How ill you are!
bal_204.
en_205. What is the cause of all this?”
bal_205.
en_206. “Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can tell.
bal_206.
en_207. Oh, save me!
bal_207.
en_208. Save me!”
bal_208.
en_209. I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
bal_209.
en_210. Poor Clerval!
bal_210.
en_211. What must have been his feelings?
bal_211.
en_212. A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.
bal_212.
en_213. But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.
bal_213.
en_214. This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.
bal_214.
en_215. During all that time Henry was my only nurse.
bal_215.
en_216. I afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.
bal_216.
en_217. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.
bal_217.
en_218. But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
bal_218.

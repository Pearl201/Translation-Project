en_1. began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.
bal_1.
en_2. “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.
bal_2.
en_3. I know it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
bal_3.
en_4. Society, I own, is necessary to me.
bal_4.
en_5. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.
bal_5.
en_6. I _must_ have employment and society.
bal_6.
en_7. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.
bal_7.
en_8. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”
bal_8.
en_9. “Indeed!”
bal_9.
en_10. “Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.
bal_10.
en_11. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
bal_11.
en_12. I cannot do justice to his kindness.
bal_12.
en_13. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”
bal_13.
en_14. “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be?
bal_14.
en_15. How could his will be disregarded?
bal_15.
en_16. Why did not you seek legal redress?”
bal_16.
en_17. “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.
bal_17.
en_18. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
bal_18.
en_19. Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.
bal_19.
en_20. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.
bal_20.
en_21. I can recall nothing worse.
bal_21.
en_22. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”
bal_22.
en_23. “This is quite shocking!
bal_23.
en_24. He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
bal_24.
en_25. “Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.
bal_25.
en_26. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”
bal_26.
en_27. Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.
bal_27.
en_28. “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?
bal_28.
en_29. what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
bal_29.
en_30. “A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.
bal_30.
en_31. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.
bal_31.
en_32. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.”
bal_32.
en_33. “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!”
bal_33.
en_34. After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.
bal_34.
en_35. His disposition must be dreadful.”
bal_35.
en_36. “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can hardly be just to him.”
bal_36.
en_37. Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!”
bal_37.
en_38. She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.”
bal_38.
en_39. But she contented herself with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner.”
bal_39.
en_40. “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.
bal_40.
en_41. _
bal_41.
en_42. My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.
bal_42.
en_43. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
bal_43.
en_44. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”
bal_44.
en_45. “How strange!” cried Elizabeth.
bal_45.
en_46. “How abominable!
bal_46.
en_47. I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you.
bal_47.
en_48. If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it.”
bal_48.
en_49. “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.
bal_49.
en_50. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.
bal_50.
en_51. But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”
bal_51.
en_52. “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
bal_52.
en_53. “Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.
bal_53.
en_54. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.
bal_54.
en_55. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.
bal_55.
en_56. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
bal_56.
en_57. “What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”
bal_57.
en_58. He shook his head.
bal_58.
en_59. “I wish I could call her amiable.
bal_59.
en_60. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.
bal_60.
en_61. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.
bal_61.
en_62. But she is nothing to me now.
bal_62.
en_63. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.
bal_63.
en_64. Since her father’s death her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.”
bal_64.
en_65. After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,-- “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley.
bal_65.
en_66. How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?
bal_66.
en_67. How can they suit each other?
bal_67.
en_68. Do you know Mr. Bingley?”
bal_68.
en_69. “Not at all.”
bal_69.
en_70. “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.
bal_70.
en_71. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.”
bal_71.
en_72. “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.
bal_72.
en_73. He does not want abilities.
bal_73.
en_74. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.
bal_74.
en_75. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.
bal_75.
en_76. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure.”
bal_76.
en_77. The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.
bal_77.
en_78. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.
bal_78.
en_79. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance; that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.
bal_79.
en_80. “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.
bal_80.
en_81. There are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”
bal_81.
en_82. Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.
bal_82.
en_83. “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living.
bal_83.
en_84. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
bal_84.
en_85. “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
bal_85.
en_86. “No, indeed, I did not.
bal_86.
en_87. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s connections.
bal_87.
en_88. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.”
bal_88.
en_89. “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
bal_89.
en_90. This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.
bal_90.
en_91. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.
bal_91.
en_92. “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
bal_92.
en_93. “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.
bal_93.
en_94. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.”
bal_94.
en_95. Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions.
bal_95.
en_96. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.
bal_96.
en_97. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
bal_97.
en_98. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.
bal_98.
en_99. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.
bal_99.
en_100. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
bal_100.
en_101. “Their reunion sparkled with unfeigned affection”
bal_101.
en_102. “Morning sun filtered through the chamber curtains” Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.
bal_102.
en_103. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.
bal_103.
en_104. The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.
bal_104.
en_105. “They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.
bal_105.
en_106. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.
bal_106.
en_107. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”
bal_107.
en_108. “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?
bal_108.
en_109. Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”
bal_109.
en_110. “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
bal_110.
en_111. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for.
bal_111.
en_112. It is impossible.
bal_112.
en_113. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.
bal_113.
en_114. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?
bal_114.
en_115. Oh no.”
bal_115.
en_116. “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.
bal_116.
en_117. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.
bal_117.
en_118. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”
bal_118.
en_119. “It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing.
bal_119.
en_120. One does not know what to think.”
bal_120.
en_121. “I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”
bal_121.
en_122. But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.
bal_122.
en_123. The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.
bal_123.
en_124. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.
bal_124.
en_125. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.
bal_125.
en_126. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.
bal_126.
en_127. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.
bal_127.
en_128. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.
bal_128.
en_129. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour.
bal_129.
en_130. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.
bal_130.
en_131. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.
bal_131.
en_132. “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough.
bal_132.
en_133. I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
bal_133.
en_134. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.”
bal_134.
en_135. Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke, either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.
bal_135.
en_136. “I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
bal_136.
en_137. Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.
bal_137.
en_138. She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed.
bal_138.
en_139. There was no help for it, however.
bal_139.
en_140. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.
bal_140.
en_141. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.
bal_141.
en_142. It now first struck her, that _
bal_142.
en_143. she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
bal_143.
en_144. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.
bal_144.
en_145. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.
bal_145.
en_146. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
bal_146.
en_147. If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time; for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.
bal_147.
en_148. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.
bal_148.
en_149. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
bal_149.
en_150. “Frost silvered the hedgerows at dawn”
bal_150.
en_151. “Carriage wheels crunched on frozen gravel” Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.
bal_151.
en_152. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.
bal_152.
en_153. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.
bal_153.
en_154. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,-- “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
bal_154.
en_155. This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
bal_155.
en_156. Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.
bal_156.
en_157. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
bal_157.
en_158. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.
bal_158.
en_159. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification.
bal_159.
en_160. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.
bal_160.
en_161. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
bal_161.
en_162. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.
bal_162.
en_163. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.
bal_163.
en_164. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind: Charlotte tried to console her.
bal_164.
en_165. “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
bal_165.
en_166. “Heaven forbid!”
bal_166.
en_167. “I shudder at the very thought!”
bal_167.
en_168. That would be the greatest misfortune of all!
bal_168.
en_169. To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
bal_169.
en_170. Do not wish me such an evil.”
bal_170.
en_171. When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence.
bal_171.
en_172. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
bal_172.
en_173. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.
bal_173.
en_174. He replied, and was again silent.
bal_174.
en_175. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time, with-- “It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.
bal_175.
en_176. “I have already spoken of the dancing.”
bal_176.
en_177. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.”
bal_177.
en_178. He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
bal_178.
en_179. “Very well; that reply will do for the present.
bal_179.
en_180. Perhaps, by-and-by, I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but _now_ we may be silent.”
bal_180.
en_181. “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
bal_181.
en_182. “Sometimes.
bal_182.
en_183. One must speak a little, you know.
bal_183.
en_184. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”
bal_184.
en_185. “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
bal_185.
en_186. “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.
bal_186.
en_187. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”
bal_187.
en_188. “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,” said he.
bal_188.
en_189. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.
bal_189.
en_190. “I have drawn you as I see you.”
bal_190.
en_191. “You think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”
bal_191.
en_192. “I must not decide on my own performance.”
bal_192.
en_193. He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.
bal_193.
en_194. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”
bal_194.
en_195. The effect was immediate.
bal_195.
en_196. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.
bal_196.
en_197. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,--
bal_197.
en_198. “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.”
bal_198.
en_199. “He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth, with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.”
bal_199.
en_200. Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.
bal_200.
en_201. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.
bal_201.
en_202. “I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very superior dancing is not often seen.
bal_202.
en_203. It is evident that you belong to the first circles.
bal_203.
en_204. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley), shall take place.
bal_204.
en_205. What congratulations will then flow in!
bal_205.
en_206. I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
bal_206.
en_207. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
bal_207.
en_208. “No couple moved with greater harmony”
bal_208.
en_209. “The music swelled in cheerful cadence” The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
bal_209.
en_210. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,-- “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.”
bal_210.
en_211. “I do not think we were speaking at all.
bal_211.
en_212. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
bal_212.
en_213. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
bal_213.
en_214. “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
bal_214.
en_215. “Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.”
bal_215.
en_216. “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.
bal_216.
en_217. We may compare our different opinions.”
bal_217.
en_218. “No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.”
bal_218.
en_219. “The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he, with a look of doubt.
bal_219.
en_220. “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable.
bal_220.
en_221. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_?”
bal_221.
en_222. “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
bal_222.
en_223. “And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
bal_223.
en_224. “I hope not.”
bal_224.
en_225. “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”
bal_225.
en_226. “May I ask to what these questions tend?”
bal_226.
en_227. “Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.
bal_227.
en_228. “I am trying to make it out.”
bal_228.
en_229. “And what is your success?”
bal_229.
en_230. She shook her head.
bal_230.
en_231. “I do not get on at all.
bal_231.
en_232. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
bal_232.
en_233. “I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
bal_233.
en_234. “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.”
bal_234.
en_235. “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
bal_235.
en_236. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
bal_236.
en_237. They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,-- “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?
bal_237.
en_238. Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward.
bal_238.
en_239. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.
bal_239.
en_240. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
bal_240.
en_241. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
bal_241.
en_242. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”
bal_242.
en_243. “His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,” said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”
bal_243.
en_244. “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
bal_244.
en_245. “Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”
bal_245.
en_246. “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.
bal_246.
en_247. “You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.
bal_247.
en_248. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.”
bal_248.
en_249. She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.
bal_249.
en_250. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
bal_250.
en_251. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.
bal_251.
en_252. “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.
bal_252.
en_253. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”
bal_253.
en_254. “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.
bal_254.
en_255. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.
bal_255.
en_256. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”
bal_256.
en_257. “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”
bal_257.
en_258. “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
bal_258.
en_259. “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.
bal_259.
en_260. I am perfectly satisfied.
bal_260.
en_261. But what does he say of the living?”
bal_261.
en_262. “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.”
bal_262.
en_263. “I have not a shadow of belief in such disinterestedness.”
bal_263.
en_264. She walked with hurried steps along the garden path.
bal_264.
en_265. Her thoughts were too tumultuous for company.
bal_265.
en_266. “Could he truly have done such a thing?”
bal_266.
en_267. The injustice to Jane pierced her heart anew.
bal_267.
en_268. Yet his words at Hunsford echoed in her mind.
bal_268.
en_269. “You are the last woman I could ever marry.”
bal_269.
en_270. Pride and pain warred within her breast.
bal_270.
en_271. She had misjudged—of that she was certain.
bal_271.
en_272. But had she misjudged him, or merely herself?
bal_272.
en_273. The sun dipped behind the hedgerows in silence.
bal_273.
en_274. And for the first time, she doubted her own discernment.
bal_274.

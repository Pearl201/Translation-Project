en_1. “A gentleman and a stranger!
bal_1.
en_2. It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure.
bal_2.
en_3. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly thing!
bal_3.
en_4. Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.
bal_4.
en_5. But--good Lord!
bal_5.
en_6. how unlucky!
bal_6.
en_7. there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.
bal_7.
en_8. Lydia, my love, ring the bell.
bal_8.
en_9. I must speak to Hill this moment.”
bal_9.
en_10. “It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.”
bal_10.
en_11. This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
bal_11.
en_12. After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.
bal_12.
en_13. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
bal_13.
en_14. “Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
bal_14.
en_15. Pray do not talk of that odious man.
bal_15.
en_16. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.”
bal_16.
en_17. Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
bal_17.
en_18. They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
bal_18.
en_19. “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
bal_19.
en_20. But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
bal_20.
en_21. “No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.
bal_21.
en_22. I hate such false friends.
bal_22.
en_23. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?”
bal_23.
en_24. “Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.”
bal_24.
en_25. “A letter arrived bearing an unfamiliar seal”
bal_25.
en_26. “Postmarked from Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent”
bal_26.
en_27. “Dated the fifteenth of October”
bal_27.
en_28. “Dear Sir, “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.”
bal_28.
en_29. “—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—“My mind, however, is now made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.”
bal_29.
en_30. “Its contents, though couched in solemn formality, betrayed an eagerness most unbecoming in a stranger.”
bal_30.
en_31. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.
bal_31.
en_32. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter.
bal_32.
en_33. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.
bal_33.
en_34. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, “WILLIAM COLLINS.”
bal_34.
en_35. “At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.
bal_35.
en_36. “He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
bal_36.
en_37. “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.”
bal_37.
en_38. “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.”
bal_38.
en_39. Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.
bal_39.
en_40. “He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.
bal_40.
en_41. “I cannot make him out.
bal_41.
en_42. There is something very pompous in his style.
bal_42.
en_43. And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?
bal_43.
en_44. We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.
bal_44.
en_45. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”
bal_45.
en_46. “No, my dear; I think not.
bal_46.
en_47. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.
bal_47.
en_48. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well.
bal_48.
en_49. I am impatient to see him.”
bal_49.
en_50. “In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem defective.
bal_50.
en_51. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.”
bal_51.
en_52. To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.
bal_52.
en_53. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.
bal_53.
en_54. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.
bal_54.
en_55. Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.
bal_55.
en_56. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.
bal_56.
en_57. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.
bal_57.
en_58. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.
bal_58.
en_59. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
bal_59.
en_60. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,-- “You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.
bal_60.
en_61. Things are settled so oddly.”
bal_61.
en_62. “You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
bal_62.
en_63. “Ah, sir, I do indeed.
bal_63.
en_64. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.
bal_64.
en_65. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things, I know, are all chance in this world.
bal_65.
en_66. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.”
bal_66.
en_67. “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.
bal_67.
en_68. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.
bal_68.
en_69. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted----”
bal_69.
en_70. He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.
bal_70.
en_71. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration.
bal_71.
en_72. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.
bal_72.
en_73. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing.
bal_73.
en_74. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.
bal_74.
en_75. He begged pardon for having displeased her.
bal_75.
en_76. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.
bal_76.
en_77. “Candles flickered above the silent table”
bal_77.
en_78. “The clatter of plates at last subsided” During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.
bal_78.
en_79. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.
bal_79.
en_80. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.
bal_80.
en_81. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.
bal_81.
en_82. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.
bal_82.
en_83. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.
bal_83.
en_84. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.
bal_84.
en_85. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
bal_85.
en_86. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations.
bal_86.
en_87. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.
bal_87.
en_88. “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.
bal_88.
en_89. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
bal_89.
en_90. Does she live near you, sir?”
bal_90.
en_91. “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”
bal_91.
en_92. “I think you said she was a widow, sir?
bal_92.
en_93. has she any family?”
bal_93.
en_94. “She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.”
bal_94.
en_95. “Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls.
bal_95.
en_96. And what sort of young lady is she?
bal_96.
en_97. Is she handsome?”
bal_97.
en_98. “She is a most charming young lady, indeed.
bal_98.
en_99. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.
bal_99.
en_100. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.
bal_100.
en_101. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
bal_101.
en_102. “Has she been presented?
bal_102.
en_103. I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.”
bal_103.
en_104. “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament.
bal_104.
en_105. Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.
bal_105.
en_106. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.
bal_106.
en_107. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.”
bal_107.
en_108. “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.
bal_108.
en_109. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”
bal_109.
en_110. “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
bal_110.
en_111. Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered.
bal_111.
en_112. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
bal_112.
en_113. By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him
bal_113.
en_114. “He claimed novels held no interest for him” to read aloud to the ladies.
bal_114.
en_115. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library)
bal_115.
en_116. he started back, and, begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.
bal_116.
en_117. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.
bal_117.
en_118. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.”
bal_118.
en_119. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,--
bal_119.
en_120. “Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard?
bal_120.
en_121. and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.
bal_121.
en_122. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.
bal_122.
en_123. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
bal_123.
en_124. Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,-- “I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.
bal_124.
en_125. It amazes me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.
bal_125.
en_126. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
bal_126.
en_127. Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.
bal_127.
en_128. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
bal_128.
en_129. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
bal_129.
en_130. “The firelight caught his stiff cravat”
bal_130.
en_131. “His manners betrayed both pride and awkwardness” Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance.
bal_131.
en_132. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.
bal_132.
en_133. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
bal_133.
en_134. Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
bal_134.
en_135. This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.
bal_135.
en_136. His plan did not vary on seeing them.
bal_136.
en_137. Miss Bennet’s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _
bal_137.
en_138. she_ was his settled choice.
bal_138.
en_139. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.
bal_139.
en_140. “As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
bal_140.
en_141. Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.
bal_141.
en_142. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
bal_142.
en_143. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.
bal_143.
en_144. Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.
bal_144.
en_145. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.
bal_145.
en_146. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.
bal_146.
en_147. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.
bal_147.
en_148. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.
bal_148.
en_149. Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.
bal_149.
en_150. But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.
bal_150.
en_151. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.
bal_151.
en_152. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.
bal_152.
en_153. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps.
bal_153.
en_154. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
bal_154.
en_155. His appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
bal_155.
en_156. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
bal_156.
en_157. On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.
bal_157.
en_158. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.
bal_158.
en_159. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.
bal_159.
en_160. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
bal_160.
en_161. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.
bal_161.
en_162. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
bal_162.
en_163. What could be the meaning of it?
bal_163.
en_164. It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
bal_164.
en_165. In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
bal_165.
en_166. Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.
bal_166.
en_167. Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield, because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him.
bal_167.
en_168. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.
bal_168.
en_169. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s commission in the ----shire.
bal_169.
en_170. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.”
bal_170.
en_171. Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.
bal_171.
en_172. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.
bal_172.
en_173. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.
bal_173.
en_174. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured, with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
bal_174.
en_175. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.
bal_175.
en_176. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips’s manners and politeness.
bal_176.
en_177. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.
bal_177.
en_178. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.
bal_178.
en_179. “Carriage wheels crunched on the gravel drive”
bal_179.
en_180. “Anticipation brightened every youthful countenance” As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.
bal_180.
en_181. When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.
bal_181.
en_182. In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.
bal_182.
en_183. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.
bal_183.
en_184. It was over at last, however.
bal_184.
en_185. The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
bal_185.
en_186. The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
bal_186.
en_187. “The regiment glittered in full assembly”
bal_187.
en_188. “Meryton society thronged with eager admiration” Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.
bal_188.
en_189. With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
bal_189.
en_190. When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her, in return, by sitting down to whist.
bal_190.
en_191. “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
bal_191.
en_192. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.
bal_192.
en_193. At first there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
bal_193.
en_194. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.
bal_194.
en_195. She dared not even mention that gentleman.
bal_195.
en_196. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.
bal_196.
en_197. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.
bal_197.
en_198. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
bal_198.
en_199. “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.”
bal_199.
en_200. “Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.
bal_200.
en_201. A clear ten thousand per annum.
bal_201.
en_202. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”
bal_202.
en_203. Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
bal_203.
en_204. “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.
bal_204.
en_205. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
bal_205.
en_206. “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly.
bal_206.
en_207. “I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.”
bal_207.
en_208. “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise.
bal_208.
en_209. I am not qualified to form one.
bal_209.
en_210. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.
bal_210.
en_211. It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.
bal_211.
en_212. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.
bal_212.
en_213. Here you are in your own family.”
bal_213.
en_214. “Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.
bal_214.
en_215. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
bal_215.
en_216. Everybody is disgusted with his pride.
bal_216.
en_217. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
bal_217.
en_218. “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_
bal_218.
en_219. I believe it does not often happen.
bal_219.
en_220. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
bal_220.
en_221. “I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.”
bal_221.
en_222. Wickham only shook his head.
bal_222.
en_223. “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”
bal_223.
en_224. “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.
bal_224.
en_225. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
bal_225.
en_226. “Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.
bal_226.
en_227. If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go.
bal_227.
en_228. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_
bal_228.
en_229. but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
bal_229.
en_230. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.
bal_230.
en_231. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.”
bal_231.
en_232. Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
bal_232.
en_233. Mr. Wickham, perceiving her attention, lowered his voice with an air of confidential regret.
bal_233.
en_234. “She could not but admire the grace with which he bore his misfortunes.”
bal_234.
en_235. “His words, though measured, carried the weight of long-suppressed feeling.”
bal_235.
en_236. “A silence ensued, fraught with unspoken implication.”
bal_236.
en_237. “The firelight played upon his features, softening their usual severity.”
bal_237.
en_238. “She turned away, lest he should read the tumult in her eyes.”
bal_238.
en_239. “It was a truth universally acknowledged, yet never so keenly felt.”
bal_239.
en_240. “Her spirits, lately so elevated, now sank beneath a cloud of doubt.”
bal_240.
en_241. “He spoke not of love, yet every syllable betrayed its presence.”
bal_241.
en_242. “The path through the shrubbery seemed longer than she remembered.”
bal_242.
en_243. “Pride and prejudice warred within her breast, each claiming victory.”
bal_243.
en_244. “A letter lay upon the tray, its seal unbroken and ominous.”
bal_244.
en_245. “She folded her hands to still their trembling.”
bal_245.
en_246. “The world outside receded, leaving only his voice in her ears.”
bal_246.
en_247. “He had changed—subtly, irrevocably—and she could not say how.”
bal_247.
en_248. “Duty and desire stood at odds, as they so often did.”
bal_248.
en_249. “The clock struck the hour, though time itself seemed suspended.”
bal_249.
en_250. “In that moment, she saw him not as he appeared, but as he truly was.”
bal_250.

en_1. and could very sincerely wish him happy.
bal_1.
en_2. All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
bal_2.
en_3. But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King.
bal_3.
en_4. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.
bal_4.
en_5. There can be no love in all this.
bal_5.
en_6. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
bal_6.
en_7. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
bal_7.
en_8. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
bal_8.
en_9. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
bal_9.
en_10. “Footsteps echoed on the narrow stair”
bal_10.
en_11. “Frost rimed the windowpanes each morning” With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.
bal_11.
en_12. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.
bal_12.
en_13. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.
bal_13.
en_14. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.
bal_14.
en_15. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.
bal_15.
en_16. The journey would, moreover, give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.
bal_16.
en_17. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch.
bal_17.
en_18. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.
bal_18.
en_19. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as perfect as plan could be.
bal_19.
en_20. The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
bal_20.
en_21. The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.
bal_21.
en_22. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.
bal_22.
en_23. Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.
bal_23.
en_24. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.
bal_24.
en_25. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long.
bal_25.
en_26. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.
bal_26.
en_27. It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.
bal_27.
en_28. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.
bal_28.
en_29. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.
bal_29.
en_30. All was joy and kindness.
bal_30.
en_31. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
bal_31.
en_32. Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.
bal_32.
en_33. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.
bal_33.
en_34. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.
bal_34.
en_35. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.
bal_35.
en_36. Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.
bal_36.
en_37. “But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King?
bal_37.
en_38. I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
bal_38.
en_39. “Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?
bal_39.
en_40. Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?
bal_40.
en_41. Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.”
bal_41.
en_42. “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.”
bal_42.
en_43. “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.
bal_43.
en_44. I know no harm of her.”
bal_44.
en_45. “But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune?”
bal_45.
en_46. “No--why should he?
bal_46.
en_47. If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?”
bal_47.
en_48. “But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.”
bal_48.
en_49. “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.
bal_49.
en_50. If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?”
bal_50.
en_51. “_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_.
bal_51.
en_52. It only shows her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
bal_52.
en_53. “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose.
bal_53.
en_54. _
bal_54.
en_55. He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
bal_55.
en_56. “No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.
bal_56.
en_57. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
bal_57.
en_58. “Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.
bal_58.
en_59. I am sick of them all.
bal_59.
en_60. Thank heaven!
bal_60.
en_61. I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him.
bal_61.
en_62. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.”
bal_62.
en_63. “Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
bal_63.
en_64. Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
bal_64.
en_65. “We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”
bal_65.
en_66. No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.
bal_66.
en_67. “My dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight!
bal_67.
en_68. what felicity!
bal_68.
en_69. You give me fresh life and vigour.
bal_69.
en_70. Adieu to disappointment and spleen.
bal_70.
en_71. What are men to rocks and mountains?
bal_71.
en_72. Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend!
bal_72.
en_73. And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything.
bal_73.
en_74. We will know where we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen.
bal_74.
en_75. Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.
bal_75.
en_76. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”
bal_76.
en_77. “The carriage halted before the threshold”
bal_77.
en_78. “Dawn gilded the hedgerows with promise” Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
bal_78.
en_79. When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
bal_79.
en_80. The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side.
bal_80.
en_81. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
bal_81.
en_82. At length the Parsonage was discernible.
bal_82.
en_83. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.
bal_83.
en_84. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.
bal_84.
en_85. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
bal_85.
en_86. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.
bal_86.
en_87. She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage: his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.
bal_87.
en_88. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.
bal_88.
en_89. Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect, and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.
bal_89.
en_90. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend, that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
bal_90.
en_91. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.
bal_91.
en_92. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.
bal_92.
en_93. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
bal_93.
en_94. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.
bal_94.
en_95. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.
bal_95.
en_96. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.
bal_96.
en_97. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.
bal_97.
en_98. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
bal_98.
en_99. From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help.
bal_99.
en_100. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.
bal_100.
en_101. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.
bal_101.
en_102. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.
bal_102.
en_103. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,-- “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.
bal_103.
en_104. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.
bal_104.
en_105. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
bal_105.
en_106. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.
bal_106.
en_107. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.
bal_107.
en_108. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us.
bal_108.
en_109. I _should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”
bal_109.
en_110. “Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
bal_110.
en_111. “Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.
bal_111.
en_112. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
bal_112.
en_113. The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.
bal_113.
en_114. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.
bal_114.
en_115. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
bal_115.
en_116. About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.
bal_116.
en_117. “Her pulse quickened at the commotion” She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,— “Oh, my dear Eliza!
bal_117.
en_118. “Voices clamoured from the hall below” “Oh, my dear Eliza!
bal_118.
en_119. pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!”
bal_119.
en_120. I will not tell you what it is.
bal_120.
en_121. Make haste, and come down this moment.”
bal_121.
en_122. Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more; and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.
bal_122.
en_123. “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.
bal_123.
en_124. “I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!”
bal_124.
en_125. “La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady Catherine.”
bal_125.
en_127. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.
bal_127.
en_128. The other is Miss De Bourgh.
bal_128.
en_129. Only look at her.
bal_129.
en_130. She is quite a little creature.
bal_130.
en_131. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”
bal_131.
en_132. “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
bal_132.
en_133. Why does she not come in?”
bal_133.
en_134. “Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.
bal_134.
en_135. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”
bal_135.
en_136. “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.
bal_136.
en_137. “She looks sickly and cross.
bal_137.
en_138. Yes, she will do for him very well.
bal_138.
en_139. She will make him a very proper wife.”
bal_139.
en_140. Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.
bal_140.
en_141. At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.
bal_141.
en_142. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.
bal_142.
en_143. “She spoke with practiced deference to her patroness”
bal_143.
en_144. “The household buzzed with Rosings’ grandeur”
bal_144.
en_145. “His self-importance swelled beyond all measure” Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
bal_145.
en_146. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.
bal_146.
en_147. “I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.
bal_147.
en_148. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.
bal_148.
en_149. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
bal_149.
en_150. Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival?”
bal_150.
en_151. “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
bal_151.
en_152. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
bal_152.
en_153. Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.
bal_153.
en_154. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
bal_154.
en_155. When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,-- “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.
bal_155.
en_156. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter.
bal_156.
en_157. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more.
bal_157.
en_158. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.
bal_158.
en_159. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”
bal_159.
en_160. While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.
bal_160.
en_161. Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James’s.
bal_161.
en_162. As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.
bal_162.
en_163. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
bal_163.
en_164. When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
bal_164.
en_165. Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her.
bal_165.
en_166. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.
bal_166.
en_167. From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.
bal_167.
en_168. Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
bal_168.
en_169. In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.
bal_169.
en_170. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
bal_170.
en_171. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.
bal_171.
en_172. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.
bal_172.
en_173. She was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.
bal_173.
en_174. When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.
bal_174.
en_175. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.
bal_175.
en_176. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.
bal_176.
en_177. After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.
bal_177.
en_178. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.
bal_178.
en_179. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
bal_179.
en_180. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.
bal_180.
en_181. The party did not supply much conversation.
bal_181.
en_182. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime.
bal_182.
en_183. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed.
bal_183.
en_184. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
bal_184.
en_185. When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.
bal_185.
en_186. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
bal_186.
en_187. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others.
bal_187.
en_188. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.
bal_188.
en_189. She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name?
bal_189.
en_190. Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.
bal_190.
en_191. Lady Catherine then observed,-- “Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think?
bal_191.
en_192. For your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.
bal_192.
en_193. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.
bal_193.
en_194. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?”
bal_194.
en_195. “A little.”
bal_195.
en_196. “Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.”
bal_196.
en_197. “Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to—”
bal_197.
en_198. “You shall try it some day.”
bal_198.
en_199. “Do your sisters play and sing?”
bal_199.
en_200. “One of them does.”
bal_200.
en_201. “Why did not you all learn?”
bal_201.
en_202. You ought all to have learned.
bal_202.
en_203. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.
bal_203.
en_204. Do you draw?”
bal_204.
en_205. “No, not at all.”
bal_205.
en_206. “What, none of you?” “Not one.”
bal_206.
en_207. “That is very strange.
bal_207.
en_208. But I suppose you had no opportunity.
bal_208.
en_209. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
bal_209.
en_210. “My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”
bal_210.
en_211. “Has your governess left you?”
bal_211.
en_212. “We never had any governess.”
bal_212.
en_213. “No governess!
bal_213.
en_214. How was that possible?
bal_214.
en_215. Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!
bal_215.
en_216. I never heard of such a thing.
bal_216.
en_217. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”
bal_217.
en_218. Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.
bal_218.
en_219. “Then who taught you?
bal_219.
en_220. who attended to you?
bal_220.
en_221. Without a governess, you must have been neglected.”
bal_221.
en_222. “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.
bal_222.
en_223. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
bal_223.
en_224. Those who chose to be idle certainly might.”
bal_224.
en_225. “Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.
bal_225.
en_226. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.
bal_226.
en_227. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.
bal_227.
en_228. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.
bal_228.
en_229. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.
bal_229.
en_230. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me?
bal_230.
en_231. She finds Miss Pope a treasure.
bal_231.
en_232. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’
bal_232.
en_233. Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
bal_233.
en_234. “Yes, ma’am, all.”
bal_234.
en_235. “All!
bal_235.
en_236. What, all five out at once?
bal_236.
en_237. Very odd!
bal_237.
en_238. And you only the second.
bal_238.
en_239. The younger ones out before the elder are married!
bal_239.
en_240. Your younger sisters must be very young?”
bal_240.
en_241. “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
bal_241.
en_242. Perhaps _
bal_242.
en_243. she_ is full young to be much in company.
bal_243.
en_244. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.
bal_244.
en_245. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first.
bal_245.
en_246. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!
bal_246.
en_247. I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
bal_247.
en_248. “Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.
bal_248.
en_249. Pray, what is your age?”
bal_249.
en_250. “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
bal_250.
en_251. Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
bal_251.
en_252. “You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age.”
bal_252.
en_253. “I am not one-and-twenty.”
bal_253.
en_254. When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.
bal_254.
en_255. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.
bal_255.
en_256. Their table was superlatively stupid.
bal_256.
en_257. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.
bal_257.
en_258. A great deal more passed at the other table.
bal_258.
en_259. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
bal_259.
en_260. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
bal_260.
en_261. Sir William did not say much.
bal_261.
en_262. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
bal_262.
en_263. When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.
bal_263.
en_264. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.
bal_264.
en_265. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed.
bal_265.
en_266. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was.
bal_266.
en_267. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s praise into his own hands.
bal_267.
en_268. “Spring sunlight warmed the parsonage walls”
bal_268.
en_269. “He departed content in his daughter’s fortune” Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.
bal_269.
en_270. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.
bal_270.
en_271. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
bal_271.
en_272. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
bal_272.
en_273. From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.
bal_273.
en_274. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.
bal_274.
en_275. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.
bal_275.
en_276. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
bal_276.
en_277. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.
bal_277.
en_278. Elizabeth soon perceived, that though her Ladyship’s condescension was oppressive, Charlotte bore it with steady composure and seemed perfectly satisfied with her situation.
bal_278.

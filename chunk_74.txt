en_1. over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read.
bal_1.
en_2. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:-- “Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think.
bal_2.
en_3. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings.
bal_3.
en_4. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings.
bal_4.
en_5. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them.
bal_5.
en_6. See I read here what Jonathan have written:-- “That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”
bal_6.
en_7. “What does this tell us?
bal_7.
en_8. Not much?
bal_8.
en_9. no!
bal_9.
en_10. The Count’s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free.
bal_10.
en_11. Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now.
bal_11.
en_12. No!
bal_12.
en_13. But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean--what it _might_ mean.
bal_13.
en_14. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then pouf!
bal_14.
en_15. and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues.
bal_15.
en_16. Is it not so?
bal_16.
en_17. Well, I shall explain.
bal_17.
en_18. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime?
bal_18.
en_19. ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’
bal_19.
en_20. You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity.
bal_20.
en_21. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not but once.
bal_21.
en_22. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad universale_.
bal_22.
en_23. There is this peculiarity in criminals.
bal_23.
en_24. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _
bal_24.
en_25. it is_.
bal_25.
en_26. That is to be empiric.
bal_26.
en_27. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
bal_27.
en_28. This criminal has not full man-brain.
bal_28.
en_29. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain.
bal_29.
en_30. He be of child-brain in much.
bal_30.
en_31. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done.
bal_31.
en_32. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more.
bal_32.
en_33. ‘_Dos pou sto_,’ said Archimedes.
bal_33.
en_34. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’
bal_34.
en_35. To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before!
bal_35.
en_36. Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled.
bal_36.
en_37. He went on:-- “Now you shall speak.
bal_37.
en_38. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes.”
bal_38.
en_39. He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
bal_39.
en_40. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:-- “The Count is a criminal and of criminal type.
bal_40.
en_41. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal
bal_41.
en_42. he is of imperfectly formed mind.
bal_42.
en_43. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.
bal_43.
en_44. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a ‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort.
bal_44.
en_45. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
bal_45.
en_46. So he came to London to invade a new land.
bal_46.
en_47. He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.”
bal_47.
en_48. “Good, good!
bal_48.
en_49. oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.
bal_49.
en_50. A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:-- “Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement.
bal_50.
en_51. I have hope.”
bal_51.
en_52. Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:-- “But go on.
bal_52.
en_53. Go on!
bal_53.
en_54. there is more to tell if you will.
bal_54.
en_55. Be not afraid; John and I know.
bal_55.
en_56. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
bal_56.
en_57. Speak, without fear!”
bal_57.
en_58. “I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”
bal_58.
en_59. “Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”
bal_59.
en_60. “Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose.
bal_60.
en_61. That purpose is remorseless.
bal_61.
en_62. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.
bal_62.
en_63. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.
bal_63.
en_64. I felt it!
bal_64.
en_65. Oh, I felt it!
bal_65.
en_66. Thank God, for His great mercy!
bal_66.
en_67. My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.”
bal_67.
en_68. The Professor stood up:-- “He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
bal_68.
en_69. But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm.
bal_69.
en_70. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says.
bal_70.
en_71. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep.
bal_71.
en_72. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail!
bal_72.
en_73. That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set.
bal_73.
en_74. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands.
bal_74.
en_75. This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where.
bal_75.
en_76. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours.
bal_76.
en_77. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him.
bal_77.
en_78. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way.
bal_78.
en_79. You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”
bal_79.
en_80. And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.
bal_80.
en_81. CHAPTER XXVI DR. SEWARD’S DIARY _29
bal_81.
en_82. October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.
bal_82.
en_83. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.
bal_83.
en_84. Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz.
bal_84.
en_85. When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance.
bal_85.
en_86. Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:-- “I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.
bal_86.
en_87. I can hear men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks.
bal_87.
en_88. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
bal_88.
en_89. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along.
bal_89.
en_90. What is this?
bal_90.
en_91. There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me.”
bal_91.
en_92. Here she stopped.
bal_92.
en_93. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight.
bal_93.
en_94. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
bal_94.
en_95. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri.
bal_95.
en_96. There was a long pause.
bal_96.
en_97. We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything.
bal_97.
en_98. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:-- “Would none of you like a cup of tea?
bal_98.
en_99. You must all be so tired!”
bal_99.
en_100. We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced.
bal_100.
en_101. She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:-- “You see, my friends.
bal_101.
en_102. _
bal_102.
en_103. He_ is close to land: he has left his earth-chest.
bal_103.
en_104. But he has yet to get on shore.
bal_104.
en_105. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land.
bal_105.
en_106. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby.
bal_106.
en_107. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape.
bal_107.
en_108. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain.
bal_108.
en_109. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
bal_109.
en_110. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”
bal_110.
en_111. There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.
bal_111.
en_112. Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance.
bal_112.
en_113. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair.
bal_113.
en_114. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made reply:-- “All is dark.
bal_114.
en_115. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood.”
bal_115.
en_116. She paused, and the red sun shot up.
bal_116.
en_117. We must wait till to-night.
bal_117.
en_118. And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation.
bal_118.
en_119. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up.
bal_119.
en_120. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.
bal_120.
en_121. *
bal_121.
en_122. * * * * _Later._--Sunset has come and gone.
bal_122.
en_123. Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
bal_123.
en_124. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning.
bal_124.
en_125. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s sensations may die away, just when we want it most.
bal_125.
en_126. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work.
bal_126.
en_127. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts.
bal_127.
en_128. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.
bal_128.
en_129. If I thought that the Count’s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so.
bal_129.
en_130. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical:-- “Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.
bal_130.
en_131. I can hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.”
bal_131.
en_132. She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy.
bal_132.
en_133. She said no more, even in answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning.
bal_133.
en_134. When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert.
bal_134.
en_135. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.
bal_135.
en_136. *
bal_136.
en_137. * *
bal_137.
en_138. * *

en_139. _30
bal_139.
en_140. October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later.
bal_140.
en_141. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
bal_141.
en_142. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.
bal_142.
en_143. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.
bal_143.
en_144. The Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:-- “All is dark.
bal_144.
en_145. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood.
bal_145.
en_146. Cattle low far off.
bal_146.
en_147. There is another sound, a queer one like----”
bal_147.
en_148. She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.
bal_148.
en_149. “Go on; go on!
bal_149.
en_150. Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonised voice.
bal_150.
en_151. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face.
bal_151.
en_152. She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:-- “Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t?
bal_152.
en_153. I don’t remember anything.”
bal_153.
en_154. Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:-- “What have I said?
bal_154.
en_155. What have I done?
bal_155.
en_156. I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on!
bal_156.
en_157. speak, I command you!’
bal_157.
en_158. It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!”
bal_158.
en_159. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!”
bal_159.
en_160. The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz.
bal_160.
en_161. We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.
bal_161.

bal_163.
en_164. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language.
bal_164.
en_165. The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry.
bal_165.
en_166. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the _Czarina Catherine_.

bal_171.
en_172. He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
bal_172.
en_173. _
bal_173.
en_174. Jonathan Harker’s Journal.
bal_174.
en_175. _ _30 October._--At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood.
bal_175.
en_176. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power.
bal_176.
en_177. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour.
bal_177.
en_178. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage.
bal_178.
en_179. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.
bal_179.
en_180. “Man!”
bal_180.
en_181. he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the average.
bal_181.
en_182. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his ain purpose.
bal_182.
en_183. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing.
bal_183.
en_184. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see.
bal_184.
en_185. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o’ aught.
bal_185.
en_186. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no.
bal_186.
en_187. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin’ him.”
bal_187.
en_188. This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:-- “Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!”
bal_188.
en_189. The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:-- “When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had started frae London.
bal_189.
en_190. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye.
bal_190.
en_191. Man!
bal_191.
en_192. but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous!
bal_192.
en_193. I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was agin the big box.
bal_193.
en_194. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a’reet.
bal_194.
en_195. An’ if he didn’t, well, we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow.
bal_195.
en_196. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
bal_196.
en_197. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river.
bal_197.
en_198. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.
bal_198.
en_199. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I’d let it lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither.
bal_199.
en_200. We didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula.
bal_200.
en_201. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.
bal_201.
en_202. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the dam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it.
bal_202.
en_203. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither than that same!”
bal_203.
en_204. “What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.
bal_204.
en_205. “I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!”
bal_205.
en_206. he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.”
bal_206.
en_207. Burgen-strasse 16 was the address.
bal_207.
en_208. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.
bal_208.
en_209. We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.
bal_209.
en_210. His arguments were pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew.
bal_210.
en_211. This turned out to be simple but important.
bal_211.
en_212. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_.
bal_212.
en_213. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.
bal_213.
en_214. He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank.
bal_214.
en_215. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage.
bal_215.
en_216. That was all he knew.
bal_216.
en_217. We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.
bal_217.
en_218. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither.
bal_218.
en_219. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money.
bal_219.
en_220. This had been between ten and eleven o’clock last night.
bal_220.
en_221. We were at a standstill again.
bal_221.
en_222. Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal.
bal_222.
en_223. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!”
bal_223.
en_224. We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.
bal_224.
en_225. As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.
bal_225.
en_226. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover.
bal_226.
en_227. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.
bal_227.
en_228. When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence.
bal_228.
en_229. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one.
bal_229.
en_230. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.

en_233. October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment.

bal_235.
en_236. It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now.
bal_236.
en_237. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.
bal_237.
en_238. His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain.
bal_238.
en_239. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts.
bal_239.
en_240. Oh!

bal_243.
en_244. Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion.
bal_244.
en_245. I shall try to follow the Professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts before me....

en_259. Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his own place.
bal_259.
en_260. (_a_)
bal_260.
en_261. He must be _brought back_ by some one.
bal_261.
en_262. This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.
bal_262.
en_263. He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.

en_269. By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.
bal_269.
en_270. (_x_)
bal_270.
en_271. There are people; and people are curious, and investigate.
bal_271.
en_272. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.
bal_272.

bal_274.

bal_275.
en_276. His pursuers might follow.
bal_276.
en_277. This is his highest fear; and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim--me!

en_278. 2. _
bal_278.
en_279. By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box.
bal_279.
en_280. It would have to take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track.
bal_280.
en_281. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to?
bal_281.
en_282. This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.
bal_282.
en_283. 3. _
bal_283.
en_284. By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another.
bal_284.
en_285. On the water he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves.
bal_285.
en_286. But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost.
bal_286.
en_287. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.
bal_287.
en_288. We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain _what_ water.
bal_288.
en_289. The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be.
bal_289.
en_290. _Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.
bal_290.
en_291. _
bal_291.
en_292. Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.
bal_292.
en_293. As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
bal_293.
en_294. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_.
bal_294.
en_295. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky.
bal_295.
en_296. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.
bal_296.
en_297. That, so far, his plans were successful we know.
bal_297.
en_298. The _Czarina Catherine_ made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson’s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz.
bal_298.
en_299. That the Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved.
bal_299.
en_300. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.
bal_300.
en_301. Skinsky took it--and here we lose the trail.
bal_301.
en_302. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along.
bal_302.
en_303. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.
bal_303.
en_304. Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on land_, at Galatz.
bal_304.
en_305. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.
bal_305.
en_306. At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form.
bal_306.
en_307. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?
bal_307.
en_308. In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class.
bal_308.
en_309. The Count wanted isolation.
bal_309.
en_310. My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way.
bal_310.
en_311. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
bal_311.
en_312. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service.
bal_312.
en_313. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river.
bal_313.
en_314. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.
bal_314.
en_315. I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.
bal_315.
en_316. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood.
bal_316.
en_317. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream.
bal_317.
en_318. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.
bal_318.
en_319. Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further.
bal_319.
en_320. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass.
bal_320.
en_321. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.

en_324. When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.
bal_324.
en_325. The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:-- “Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.
bal_325.
en_326. Her eyes have been where we were blinded.
bal_326.
en_327. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed.
bal_327.
en_328. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.
bal_328.
en_329. He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.
bal_329.
en_330. This he knows, and will not.

bal_332.
en_333. “And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr. Morris.
bal_333.
en_334. “Good!” said the Professor, “both good.
bal_334.
en_335. But neither must go alone.
bal_335.
en_336. There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.”
bal_336.
en_337. All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal.
bal_337.
en_338. Said Mr. Morris:--
bal_338.
en_339. “I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.
bal_339.
en_340. The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand.
bal_340.
en_341. We must be ready at all points.”
bal_341.
en_342. Dr. Seward said:-- “I think I had better go with Quincey.

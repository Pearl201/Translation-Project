en_1. dared not.
bal_1.
en_2. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.
bal_2.
en_3. “The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.
bal_3.
en_4. The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.
bal_4.
en_5. “This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
bal_5.
en_6. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.
bal_6.
en_7. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.
bal_7.
en_8. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.
bal_8.
en_9. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
bal_9.
en_10. “They were not entirely happy.
bal_10.
en_11. The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.
bal_11.
en_12. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.
bal_12.
en_13. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.
bal_13.
en_14. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?
bal_14.
en_15. They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.
bal_15.
en_16. What did their tears imply?
bal_16.
en_17. Did they really express pain?
bal_17.
en_18. I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.
bal_18.
en_19. “A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.
bal_19.
en_20. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.
bal_20.
en_21. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.
bal_21.
en_22. “This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.
bal_22.
en_23. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.
bal_23.
en_24. “I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.
bal_24.
en_25. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
bal_25.
en_26. “I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.
bal_26.
en_27. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.
bal_27.
en_28. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.
bal_28.
en_29. “By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.
bal_29.
en_30. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.
bal_30.
en_31. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.
bal_31.
en_32. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.
bal_32.
en_33. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.
bal_33.
en_34. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.
bal_34.
en_35. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood.
bal_35.
en_36. _
bal_36.
en_37. I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.
bal_37.
en_38. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._
bal_38.
en_39. The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _
bal_39.
en_40. Felix, brother,_ or _son_.
bal_40.
en_41. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.
bal_41.
en_42. I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._
bal_42.
en_43. “I spent the winter in this manner.
bal_43.
en_44. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.
bal_44.
en_45. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.
bal_45.
en_46. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.
bal_46.
en_47. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.
bal_47.
en_48. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.
bal_48.
en_49. It was not thus with Felix.
bal_49.
en_50. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.
bal_50.
en_51. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.
bal_51.
en_52. “I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.
bal_52.
en_53. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.
bal_53.
en_54. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.
bal_54.
en_55. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.
bal_55.
en_56. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.
bal_56.
en_57. “This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.
bal_57.
en_58. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?
bal_58.
en_59. I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.
bal_59.
en_60. “I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!
bal_60.
en_61. At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
bal_61.
en_62. Alas!
bal_62.
en_63. I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
bal_63.
en_64. “As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.
bal_64.
en_65. From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.
bal_65.
en_66. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
bal_66.
en_67. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.
bal_67.
en_68. “The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.
bal_68.
en_69. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
bal_69.
en_70. “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.
bal_70.
en_71. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.
bal_71.
en_72. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.
bal_72.
en_73. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.
bal_73.
en_74. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.
bal_74.
en_75. “My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.
bal_75.
en_76. I thought (foolish wretch!)
bal_76.
en_77. that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.
bal_77.
en_78. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.
bal_78.
en_79. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.
bal_79.
en_80. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.
bal_80.
en_81. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.
bal_81.
en_82. “These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.
bal_82.
en_83. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
bal_83.
en_84. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.
bal_84.
en_85. “The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.
bal_85.
en_86. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.
bal_86.
en_87. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.
bal_87.
en_88. Happy, happy earth!
bal_88.
en_89. Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.
bal_89.
en_90. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”
bal_90.
en_91. Chapter 13
bal_91.
en_92. “I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.
bal_92.
en_93. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.
bal_93.
en_94. “Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.
bal_94.
en_95. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.
bal_95.
en_96. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.
bal_96.
en_97. “It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow.
bal_97.
en_98. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
bal_98.
en_99. “It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
bal_99.
en_100. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.
bal_100.
en_101. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
bal_101.
en_102. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.
bal_102.
en_103. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.
bal_103.
en_104. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.
bal_104.
en_105. “Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.
bal_105.
en_106. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.
bal_106.
en_107. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled.
bal_107.
en_108. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.
bal_108.
en_109. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
bal_109.
en_110. “I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.
bal_110.
en_111. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.
bal_111.
en_112. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.
bal_112.
en_113. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.
bal_113.
en_114. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.
bal_114.
en_115. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.
bal_115.
en_116. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.
bal_116.
en_117. “As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.
bal_117.
en_118. When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night sweet Safie.’
bal_118.
en_119. He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.
bal_119.
en_120. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.
bal_120.
en_121. “The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.
bal_121.
en_122. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
bal_122.
en_123. “When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.
bal_123.
en_124. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.
bal_124.
en_125. The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
bal_125.
en_126. “The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
bal_126.
en_127. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.
bal_127.
en_128. “In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.
bal_128.
en_129. “My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.
bal_129.
en_130. “While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.
bal_130.
en_131. “The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins of Empires_.
bal_131.
en_132. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.
bal_132.
en_133. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.
bal_133.
en_134. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.
bal_134.
en_135. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.
bal_135.
en_136. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
bal_136.
en_137. “These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.
bal_137.
en_138. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?
bal_138.
en_139. He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.
bal_139.
en_140. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.
bal_140.
en_141. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.
bal_141.
en_142. “Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
bal_142.
en_143. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.
bal_143.
en_144. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
bal_144.
en_145. “The words induced me to turn towards myself.
bal_145.
en_146. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.
bal_146.
en_147. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!
bal_147.
en_148. And what was I?
bal_148.
en_149. Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.
bal_149.
en_150. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.
bal_150.
en_151. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.
bal_151.
en_152. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.
bal_152.
en_153. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
bal_153.
en_154. “I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.
bal_154.
en_155. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
bal_155.
en_156. “Of what a strange nature is knowledge!
bal_156.
en_157. It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.
bal_157.
en_158. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand.
bal_158.
en_159. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.
bal_159.
en_160. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.
bal_160.
en_161. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.
bal_161.
en_162. Miserable, unhappy wretch!
bal_162.
en_163. “Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
bal_163.
en_164. I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
bal_164.
en_165. “But where were my friends and relations?
bal_165.
en_166. No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.
bal_166.
en_167. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.
bal_167.
en_168. I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.
bal_168.
en_169. What was I?
bal_169.
en_170. The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
bal_170.
en_171. “I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”
bal_171.
en_172. Chapter 14
bal_172.
en_173. “Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.
bal_173.
en_174. It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.
bal_174.
en_175. “The name of the old man was De Lacey.
bal_175.
en_176. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.
bal_176.
en_177. His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.
bal_177.
en_178. A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
bal_178.
en_179. “The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.
bal_179.
en_180. He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
bal_180.
en_181. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.
bal_181.
en_182. He was tried and condemned to death.
bal_182.
en_183. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.
bal_183.
en_184. “Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.
bal_184.
en_185. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.
bal_185.
en_186. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.
bal_186.
en_187. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.
bal_187.
en_188. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.
bal_188.
en_189. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
bal_189.
en_190. “The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.
bal_190.
en_191. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.
bal_191.
en_192. “During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French.
bal_192.
en_193. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.
bal_193.
en_194. “I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.
bal_194.
en_195. Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.
bal_195.
en_196. “Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.
bal_196.
en_197. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.
bal_197.
en_198. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.
bal_198.
en_199. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.
bal_199.
en_200. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.
bal_200.
en_201. “The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.
bal_201.
en_202. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.
bal_202.
en_203. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.
bal_203.
en_204. “Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
bal_204.
en_205. “Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.
bal_205.
en_206. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.
bal_206.
en_207. “The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.
bal_207.
en_208. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.
bal_208.
en_209. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.
bal_209.
en_210. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
bal_210.
en_211. “The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.
bal_211.
en_212. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.
bal_212.
en_213. The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.
bal_213.
en_214. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.
bal_214.
en_215. This idea was torture to him.
bal_215.
en_216. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.
bal_216.
en_217. “He did not succeed.
bal_217.
en_218. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
bal_218.
en_219. “They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.
bal_219.
en_220. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.
bal_220.
en_221. “Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.
bal_221.
en_222. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.
bal_222.
en_223. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
bal_223.
en_224. “When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.
bal_224.
en_225. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.
bal_225.
en_226. “A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.
bal_226.
en_227. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.
bal_227.
en_228. “When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.
bal_228.
en_229. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.
bal_229.
en_230. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then

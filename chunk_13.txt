en_1. young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.
bal_1.
en_2. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told [Illustration: “Meeting accidentally in Town” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] himself.
bal_2.
en_3. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring.
bal_3.
en_4. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
bal_4.
en_5. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance.
bal_5.
en_6. But no such recollection befriended her.
bal_6.
en_7. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.
bal_7.
en_8. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.
bal_8.
en_9. But, alas!
bal_9.
en_10. the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question.
bal_10.
en_11. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.
bal_11.
en_12. She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.
bal_12.
en_13. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.
bal_13.
en_14. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.
bal_14.
en_15. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.
bal_15.
en_16. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _
bal_16.
en_17. he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.
bal_17.
en_18. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.
bal_18.
en_19. How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
bal_19.
en_20. His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
bal_20.
en_21. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown.
bal_21.
en_22. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.
bal_22.
en_23. She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.
bal_23.
en_24. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
bal_24.
en_25. “How despicably have I acted!”
bal_25.
en_26. she cried.
bal_26.
en_27. “I, who have prided myself on my discernment!
bal_27.
en_28. I, who have valued myself on my abilities!
bal_28.
en_29. who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust.
bal_29.
en_30. How humiliating is this discovery!
bal_30.
en_31. Yet, how just a humiliation!
bal_31.
en_32. Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.
bal_32.
en_33. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.
bal_33.
en_34. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned.
bal_34.
en_35. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”
bal_35.
en_36. From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.
bal_36.
en_37. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.
bal_37.
en_38. How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?
bal_38.
en_39. He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had always been.
bal_39.
en_40. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.
bal_40.
en_41. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.
bal_41.
en_42. When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense of shame was severe.
bal_42.
en_43. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.
bal_43.
en_44. The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.
bal_44.
en_45. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.
bal_45.
en_46. After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
bal_46.
en_47. She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.
bal_47.
en_48. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.
bal_48.
en_49. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.
bal_49.
en_50. She could think only of her letter.
bal_50.
en_51. [Illustration: “His parting obeisance” ] CHAPTER XXXVII.
bal_51.
en_52. [Illustration] The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.
bal_52.
en_53. To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.
bal_53.
en_54. Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her Ladyship’s indignation would have been.
bal_54.
en_55. “What would she have said?
bal_55.
en_56. how would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused herself.
bal_56.
en_57. Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party.
bal_57.
en_58. “I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.
bal_58.
en_59. But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
bal_59.
en_60. They were excessively sorry to go!
bal_60.
en_61. But so they always are.
bal_61.
en_62. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year.
bal_62.
en_63. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
bal_63.
en_64. Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
bal_64.
en_65. Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,-- “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.
bal_65.
en_66. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.”
bal_66.
en_67. “I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it.
bal_67.
en_68. I must be in town next Saturday.”
bal_68.
en_69. “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.
bal_69.
en_70. I expected you to stay two months.
bal_70.
en_71. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.
bal_71.
en_72. There can be no occasion for your going so soon.
bal_72.
en_73. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”
bal_73.
en_74. “But my father cannot.
bal_74.
en_75. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
bal_75.
en_76. [Illustration: “Dawson” [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]] “Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
bal_76.
en_77. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.
bal_77.
en_78. And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”
bal_78.
en_79. “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.”
bal_79.
en_80. Lady Catherine seemed resigned.
bal_80.
en_81. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.
bal_81.
en_82. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
bal_82.
en_83. It is highly improper.
bal_83.
en_84. You must contrive to send somebody.
bal_84.
en_85. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.
bal_85.
en_86. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.
bal_86.
en_87. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.
bal_87.
en_88. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.
bal_88.
en_89. I am excessively attentive to all those things.
bal_89.
en_90. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.
bal_90.
en_91. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
bal_91.
en_92. “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
bal_92.
en_93. “Oh!
bal_93.
en_94. Your uncle!
bal_94.
en_95. He keeps a man-servant, does he?
bal_95.
en_96. I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.
bal_96.
en_97. Where shall you change horses?
bal_97.
en_98. Oh, Bromley, of course.
bal_98.
en_99. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.”
bal_99.
en_100. Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.
bal_100.
en_101. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.
bal_101.
en_102. Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
bal_102.
en_103. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.
bal_103.
en_104. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
bal_104.
en_105. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.
bal_105.
en_106. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
bal_106.
en_107. They were hopeless of remedy.
bal_107.
en_108. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.
bal_108.
en_109. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?
bal_109.
en_110. Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.
bal_110.
en_111. They were ignorant, idle, and vain.
bal_111.
en_112. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.
bal_112.
en_113. Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.
bal_113.
en_114. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
bal_114.
en_115. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
bal_115.
en_116. When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
bal_116.
en_117. Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.
bal_117.
en_118. The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
bal_118.
en_119. When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both.
bal_119.
en_120. [Illustration: “The elevation of his feelings.”
bal_120.
en_121. ] CHAPTER XXXVIII.
bal_121.
en_122. [Illustration] On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
bal_122.
en_123. “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
bal_123.
en_124. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.
bal_124.
en_125. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.
bal_125.
en_126. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly.”
bal_126.
en_127. Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
bal_127.
en_128. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.
bal_128.
en_129. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,-- “It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.
bal_129.
en_130. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.
bal_130.
en_131. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.
bal_131.
en_132. You see on what a footing we are.
bal_132.
en_133. You see how continually we are engaged there.
bal_133.
en_134. In truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
bal_134.
en_135. Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.
bal_135.
en_136. “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.
bal_136.
en_137. I flatter myself, at least, that you will be able to do so.
bal_137.
en_138. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.
bal_138.
en_139. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
bal_139.
en_140. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
bal_140.
en_141. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.
bal_141.
en_142. We seem to have been designed for each other.”
bal_142.
en_143. Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.
bal_143.
en_144. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang.
bal_144.
en_145. Poor Charlotte!
bal_145.
en_146. it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
bal_146.
en_147. But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.
bal_147.
en_148. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
bal_148.
en_149. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
bal_149.
en_150. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.
bal_150.
en_151. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.
bal_151.
en_152. [Illustration: “They had forgotten to leave any message” ]
bal_152.
en_153. “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.”
bal_153.
en_154. Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.
bal_154.
en_155. “Good gracious!”
bal_155.
en_156. cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems but a day or two since we first came!
bal_156.
en_157. and yet how many things have happened!”
bal_157.
en_158. “A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.
bal_158.
en_159. “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
bal_159.
en_160. How much I shall have to tell!”
bal_160.
en_161. Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
bal_161.
en_162. Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few days.
bal_162.
en_163. Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.
bal_163.
en_164. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
bal_164.
en_165. It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals.
bal_165.
en_166. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate, and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister further.
bal_166.
en_167. [Illustration: “How nicely we are crammed in” ] CHAPTER XXXIX.
bal_167.
en_168. [Illustration] It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
bal_168.
en_169. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.
bal_169.
en_170. After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice?
bal_170.
en_171. is not this an agreeable surprise?”
bal_171.
en_172. “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.”
bal_172.
en_173. Then showing her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet.
bal_173.
en_174. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
bal_174.
en_175. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.”
bal_175.
en_176. And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
bal_176.
en_177. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.”
bal_177.
en_178. “Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
bal_178.
en_179. “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!
bal_179.
en_180. It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.
bal_180.
en_181. Mamma would like to go, too, of all things!
bal_181.
en_182. Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!”
bal_182.
en_183. “Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.
bal_183.
en_184. Good Heaven!
bal_184.
en_185. Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
bal_185.
en_186. “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to table.
bal_186.
en_187. “What do you think?
bal_187.
en_188. It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.”
bal_188.
en_189. Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.
bal_189.
en_190. Lydia laughed, and said,-- “Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion.
bal_190.
en_191. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!
bal_191.
en_192. I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.
bal_192.
en_193. But he is an ugly fellow!
bal_193.
en_194. I am glad he is gone.
bal_194.
en_195. I never saw such a long chin in my life.
bal_195.
en_196. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
bal_196.
en_197. There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you!
bal_197.
en_198. She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.
bal_198.
en_199. Wickham is safe.”
bal_199.
en_200. “And Mary King is safe!”
bal_200.
en_201. added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.”
bal_201.
en_202. “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
bal_202.
en_203. “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
bal_203.
en_204. “I am sure there is not on _his_.
bal_204.
en_205. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her.
bal_205.
en_206. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?”
bal_206.
en_207. Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!
bal_207.
en_208. As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
bal_208.
en_209. “How nicely we are crammed in!”
bal_209.
en_210. cried Lydia.
bal_210.
en_211. “I am glad I brought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box!
bal_211.
en_212. Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
bal_212.
en_213. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.
bal_213.
en_214. Have you seen any pleasant men?
bal_214.
en_215. Have you had any flirting?
bal_215.
en_216. I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
bal_216.
en_217. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
bal_217.
en_218. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord!
bal_218.
en_219. how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
bal_219.
en_220. My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you can’t think.
bal_220.
en_221. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.
bal_221.
en_222. Lord!
bal_222.
en_223. how I should like to be married before any of you!
bal_223.
en_224. and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls.
bal_224.
en_225. Dear me!
bal_225.
en_226. we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s!
bal_226.
en_227. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!)
bal_227.
en_228. and so she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?
bal_228.
en_229. We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun!
bal_229.
en_230. Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!
bal_230.
en_231. When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.
bal_231.
en_232. Lord!
bal_232.
en_233. how I laughed!
bal_233.
en_234. and so did Mrs. Forster.
bal_234.
en_235. I thought I should have died.
bal_235.
en_236. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
bal_236.
en_237. With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.
bal_237.
en_238. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.
bal_238.
en_239. Their reception at home was most kind.
bal_239.
en_240. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,---- “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
bal_240.
en_241. Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
bal_241.
en_242. “Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
bal_242.
en_243. as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.
bal_243.
en_244. And then when we came away it was such fun!
bal_244.
en_245. I thought we never should have got into the coach.
bal_245.
en_246. I was ready to die of laughter.
bal_246.
en_247. And then we were so merry all the way home!
bal_247.
en_248. we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
bal_248.
en_249. To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.
bal_249.
en_250. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.
bal_250.
en_251. But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.
bal_251.
en_252. I should infinitely prefer a book.”
bal_252.
en_253. But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.
bal_253.
en_254. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
bal_254.
en_255. In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.
bal_255.
en_256. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
bal_256.
en_257. There was another reason, too, for her opposition.
bal_257.
en_258. She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.
bal_258.
en_259. The comfort to _her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.
bal_259.
en_260. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
bal_260.
en_261. She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.
bal_261.
en_262. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
bal_262.
en_263. [Illustration] CHAPTER XL.
bal_263.
en_264. [Illustration] Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
bal_264.
en_265. Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.
bal_265.
en_266. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
bal_266.
en_267. “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.”
bal_267.
en_268. “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
bal_268.
en_269. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
bal_269.
en_270. “Blame you!
bal_270.
en_271. Oh, no.”
bal_271.
en_272. “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
bal_272.
en_273. “No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
bal_273.
en_274. “But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.”
bal_274.
en_275. She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.
bal_275.
en_276. What a stroke was this for poor Jane, who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual!
bal_276.
en_277. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
bal_277.
en_278. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
bal_278.
en_279. “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything.
bal_279.
en_280. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.
bal_280.
en_281. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man;
bal_281.

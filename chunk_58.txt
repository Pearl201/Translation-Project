en_1. it.”
bal_1.
en_2. Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation.
bal_2.
en_3. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.
bal_3.
en_4. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was.
bal_4.
en_5. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
bal_5.
en_6. But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.
bal_6.
en_7. I could hear my own heart beat.
bal_7.
en_8. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.
bal_8.
en_9. It is enough.
bal_9.
en_10. You attend him; I will look to her.”
bal_10.
en_11. When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened.
bal_11.
en_12. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:-- “The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.”
bal_12.
en_13. And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient’s head.
bal_13.
en_14. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat.
bal_14.
en_15. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s ways of betraying emotion.
bal_15.
en_16. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while.
bal_16.
en_17. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love.
bal_17.
en_18. He must not stay here.
bal_18.
en_19. Hold!
bal_19.
en_20. a moment.
bal_20.
en_21. I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result.
bal_21.
en_22. Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful.
bal_22.
en_23. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is.
bal_23.
en_24. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you have done.
bal_24.
en_25. Good-bye.”
bal_25.
en_26. When Arthur had gone I went back to the room.
bal_26.
en_27. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved.
bal_27.
en_28. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
bal_28.
en_29. The velvet band again covered the red mark.
bal_29.
en_30. I asked the Professor in a whisper:-- “What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
bal_30.
en_31. “What do you make of it?”
bal_31.
en_32. “I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band.
bal_32.
en_33. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking.
bal_33.
en_34. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration.
bal_34.
en_35. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be.
bal_35.
en_36. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
bal_36.
en_37. “Well?” said Van Helsing.
bal_37.
en_38. “Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.”
bal_38.
en_39. The Professor stood up.
bal_39.
en_40. “I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said.
bal_40.
en_41. “There are books and things there which I want.
bal_41.
en_42. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her.”
bal_42.
en_43. “Shall I have a nurse?”
bal_43.
en_44. I asked.
bal_44.
en_45. “We are the best nurses, you and I.
bal_45.
en_46. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.
bal_46.
en_47. You must not sleep all the night.
bal_47.
en_48. Later on we can sleep, you and I.
bal_48.
en_49. I shall be back as soon as possible.
bal_49.
en_50. And then we may begin.”
bal_50.
en_51. “May begin?”
bal_51.
en_52. I said.
bal_52.
en_53. “What on earth do you mean?”
bal_53.
en_54. “We shall see!”
bal_54.
en_55. he answered, as he hurried out.
bal_55.
en_56. He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:-- “Remember, she is your charge.
bal_56.
en_57. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
bal_57.
en_58. _Dr. Seward’s Diary--continued.
bal_58.
en_59. _ _8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy.
bal_59.
en_60. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation.
bal_60.
en_61. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.
bal_61.
en_62. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed strength and excellent spirits.
bal_62.
en_63. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.
bal_63.
en_64. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.
bal_64.
en_65. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye.
bal_65.
en_66. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off.
bal_66.
en_67. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on.
bal_67.
en_68. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:-- “You do not want to go to sleep?”
bal_68.
en_69. “No; I am afraid.”
bal_69.
en_70. “Afraid to go to sleep!
bal_70.
en_71. Why so?
bal_71.
en_72. It is the boon we all crave for.”
bal_72.
en_73. “Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”
bal_73.
en_74. “A presage of horror!
bal_74.
en_75. What on earth do you mean?”
bal_75.
en_76. “I don’t know; oh, I don’t know.
bal_76.
en_77. And that is what is so terrible.
bal_77.
en_78. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”
bal_78.
en_79. “But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night.
bal_79.
en_80. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen.”
bal_80.
en_81. “Ah, I can trust you!”
bal_81.
en_82. I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”
bal_82.
en_83. “You will?
bal_83.
en_84. Oh, will you really?
bal_84.
en_85. How good you are to me.
bal_85.
en_86. Then I will sleep!”
bal_86.
en_87. And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.
bal_87.
en_88. All night long I watched by her.
bal_88.
en_89. She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep.
bal_89.
en_90. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.
bal_90.
en_91. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
bal_91.
en_92. In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things.
bal_92.
en_93. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation.
bal_93.
en_94. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoöphagous patient.
bal_94.
en_95. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night.
bal_95.
en_96. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.
bal_96.
en_97. *
bal_97.
en_98. * *
bal_98.
en_99. * * _9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham.
bal_99.
en_100. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion.
bal_100.
en_101. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits.
bal_101.
en_102. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:-- “No sitting up to-night for you.
bal_102.
en_103. You are worn out.
bal_103.
en_104. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.”
bal_104.
en_105. I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.
bal_105.
en_106. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port.
bal_106.
en_107. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.
bal_107.
en_108. “Now,” she said, “you must stay here.
bal_108.
en_109. I shall leave this door open and my door too.
bal_109.
en_110. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon.
bal_110.
en_111. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.”
bal_111.
en_112. I could not but acquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.
bal_112.
en_113. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
bal_113.
en_114. _

en_115. Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
bal_115.
en_116. _ _9 September._--I feel so happy to-night.
bal_116.
en_117. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky.
bal_117.
en_118. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.
bal_118.
en_119. I seem to feel his presence warm about me.
bal_119.
en_120. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills.
bal_120.
en_121. I know where my thoughts are.
bal_121.
en_122. If Arthur only knew!
bal_122.
en_123. My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking.
bal_123.
en_124. Oh, the blissful rest of last night!
bal_124.
en_125. How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
bal_125.
en_126. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call.
bal_126.
en_127. Thank everybody for being so good to me!
bal_127.
en_128. Thank God!
bal_128.
en_129. Good-night, Arthur. _Dr. Seward’s Diary.
bal_129.
en_130. _ _
bal_130.
en_131. 10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and started awake all in a second.
bal_131.
en_132. That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.
bal_132.
en_133. “And how is our patient?”
bal_133.
en_134. “Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.
bal_134.
en_135. “Come, let us see,” he said.
bal_135.
en_136. And together we went into the room.
bal_136.
en_137. The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
bal_137.
en_138. As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.
bal_138.
en_139. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from his agonised face.
bal_139.
en_140. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white.
bal_140.
en_141. I felt my knees begin to tremble.
bal_141.
en_142. There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever.
bal_142.
en_143. Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness.
bal_143.
en_144. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly.
bal_144.
en_145. “Quick!”
bal_145.
en_146. he said.
bal_146.
en_147. “Bring the brandy.”
bal_147.
en_148. I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
bal_148.
en_149. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart.
bal_149.
en_150. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:-- “It is not too late.
bal_150.
en_151. It beats, though but feebly.
bal_151.
en_152. All our work is undone; we must begin again.
bal_152.
en_153. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.”
bal_153.
en_154. As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve.
bal_154.
en_155. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment’s delay, we began the operation.
bal_155.
en_156. After a time--it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing held up a warning finger.
bal_156.
en_157. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger.
bal_157.
en_158. But I shall precaution take.
bal_158.
en_159. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.”
bal_159.
en_160. He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.
bal_160.
en_161. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep.
bal_161.
en_162. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips.
bal_162.
en_163. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
bal_163.
en_164. The Professor watched me critically.
bal_164.
en_165. “That will do,” he said.
bal_165.
en_166. “Already?”
bal_166.
en_167. I remonstrated.
bal_167.
en_168. “You took a great deal more from Art.”
bal_168.
en_169. To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:-- “He is her lover, her _fiancé_.
bal_169.
en_170. You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will suffice.”
bal_170.
en_171. When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision.
bal_171.
en_172. I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick.
bal_172.
en_173. By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.
bal_173.
en_174. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:-- “Mind, nothing must be said of this.
bal_174.
en_175. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him.
bal_175.
en_176. It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too.
bal_176.
en_177. There must be none.
bal_177.
en_178. So!”
bal_178.
en_179. When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:-- “You are not much the worse.
bal_179.
en_180. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
bal_180.
en_181. I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were.
bal_181.
en_182. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength.
bal_182.
en_183. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred.
bal_183.
en_184. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it.
bal_184.
en_185. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges--tiny though they were.
bal_185.
en_186. Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before.
bal_186.
en_187. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment.
bal_187.
en_188. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
bal_188.
en_189. Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened.
bal_189.
en_190. I tried to keep her amused and interested.
bal_190.
en_191. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:--
bal_191.
en_192. “We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.
bal_192.
en_193. You are looking pale yourself.
bal_193.
en_194. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do!”
bal_194.
en_195. As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head.
bal_195.
en_196. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me.
bal_196.
en_197. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
bal_197.
en_198. Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: “Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough.
bal_198.
en_199. Make yourself strong.
bal_199.
en_200. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself.
bal_200.
en_201. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know.
bal_201.
en_202. I have grave reasons.
bal_202.
en_203. No, do not ask them; think what you will.
bal_203.
en_204. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable.
bal_204.
en_205. Good-night.”
bal_205.
en_206. In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.
bal_206.
en_207. They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign gentleman.”
bal_207.
en_208. I was much touched by their kindness.
bal_208.
en_209. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman’s kindness.
bal_209.
en_210. I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.
bal_210.
en_211. It is coming.

bal_215.
en_216. September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham.
bal_216.
en_217. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.
bal_217.
en_218. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor.
bal_218.
en_219. He opened it with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of white flowers.
bal_219.
en_220. “These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.
bal_220.
en_221. “For me?
bal_221.
en_222. Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”
bal_222.
en_223. “Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with.
bal_223.
en_224. These are medicines.”
bal_224.
en_225. Here Lucy made a wry face.
bal_225.
en_226. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort.
bal_226.
en_227. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.
bal_227.
en_228. This is medicinal, but you do not know how.
bal_228.
en_229. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well.
bal_229.
en_230. Oh yes!
bal_230.
en_231. they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten.
bal_231.
en_232. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”
bal_232.
en_233. Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.
bal_233.
en_234. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:-- “Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.
bal_234.
en_235. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.”
bal_235.
en_236. To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:-- “No trifling with me!
bal_236.
en_237. I never jest!
bal_237.
en_238. There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me.
bal_238.
en_239. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.”
bal_239.
en_240. Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.
bal_240.
en_241. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers.
bal_241.
en_242. See, I place them myself in your room.
bal_242.
en_243. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.
bal_243.
en_244. But hush!
bal_244.
en_245. no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions.
bal_245.
en_246. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you.
bal_246.
en_247. Now sit still awhile.
bal_247.
en_248. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
bal_248.
en_249. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”
bal_249.
en_250. We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.
bal_250.
en_251. The Professor’s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of.
bal_251.
en_252. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell.
bal_252.
en_253. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way.
bal_253.
en_254. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:-- “Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me.
bal_254.
en_255. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
bal_255.
en_256. “Perhaps I am!”
bal_256.
en_257. he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.
bal_257.
en_258. We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck.
bal_258.
en_259. The last words he said to her were:-- “Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door.”
bal_259.
en_260. “I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me!
bal_260.
en_261. Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?”
bal_261.
en_262. As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:-- “To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink.
bal_262.
en_263. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work.
bal_263.
en_264. Ho! ho!”
bal_264.
en_265. He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror.
bal_265.
en_266. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
bal_266.
en_267. CHAPTER XI _Lucy Westenra’s Diary._ _12 September._--How good they all are to me.
bal_267.
en_268. I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing.
bal_268.
en_269. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.
bal_269.
en_270. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce.
bal_270.
en_271. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already.
bal_271.
en_272. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear.
bal_272.
en_273. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window.
bal_273.
en_274. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me!
bal_274.
en_275. How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.
bal_275.
en_276. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden strewments.”
bal_276.
en_277. I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
bal_277.
en_278. There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already.
bal_278.
en_279. Good-night, everybody.

bal_281.
en_282. _ _13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time.
bal_282.
en_283. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.
bal_283.
en_284. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.
bal_284.
en_285. Let all be put down exactly.
bal_285.
en_286. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o’clock.
bal_286.
en_287. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s annual work.
bal_287.
en_288. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees.
bal_288.
en_289. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.
bal_289.
en_290. She is always an early riser.
bal_290.
en_291. She greeted us warmly and said:-- “You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.
bal_291.
en_292. The dear child is still asleep.
bal_292.
en_293. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.”
bal_293.
en_294. The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant.
bal_294.
en_295. He rubbed his hands together, and said:-- “Aha!
bal_295.
en_296. I thought I had diagnosed the case.
bal_296.
en_297. My treatment is working,” to which she answered:-- “You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor.
bal_297.
en_298. Lucy’s state this morning is due in part to me.”
bal_298.
en_299. “How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.
bal_299.
en_300. “Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room.
bal_300.
en_301. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did not wake her.
bal_301.
en_302. But the room was awfully stuffy.
bal_302.
en_303. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck.
bal_303.
en_304. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.
bal_304.
en_305. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.”
bal_305.
en_306. She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early.
bal_306.
en_307. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen grey.
bal_307.
en_308. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room.
bal_308.
en_309. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
bal_309.
en_310. Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down.
bal_310.
en_311. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart.
bal_311.
en_312. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe.
bal_312.
en_313. “God!
bal_313.
en_314. God!
bal_314.
en_315. God!”
bal_315.
en_316. he said.
bal_316.
en_317. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?
bal_317.
en_318. Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?
bal_318.
en_319. This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die.
bal_319.
en_320. Oh, how we are beset!
bal_320.
en_321. How are all the powers of the devils against us!”
bal_321.
en_322. Suddenly he jumped to his feet.
bal_322.
en_323. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act.
bal_323.
en_324. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.”
bal_324.
en_325. He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy’s room.
bal_325.
en_326. Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
bal_326.
en_327. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before.
bal_327.
en_328. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.
bal_328.
en_329. “As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much.
bal_329.
en_330. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood.
bal_330.
en_331. I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand.
bal_331.
en_332. “No!” he said.
bal_332.
en_333. “To-day you must operate.
bal_333.
en_334. I shall provide.
bal_334.
en_335. You are weakened already.”
bal_335.
en_336. As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.
bal_336.
en_337. Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.
bal_337.
en_338. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.
bal_338.
en_339. Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure.
bal_339.
en_340. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.
bal_340.
en_341. After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
bal_341.
en_342. What does it all mean?
bal_342.
en_343. I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.

en_345. _17
bal_345.
en_346. September._--Four days and nights of peace.
bal_346.
en_347. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself.
bal_347.
en_348. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me.
bal_348.
en_349. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water.
bal_349.
en_350. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased.
bal_350.
en_351. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep.
bal_351.
en_352. I do not even try to keep awake.
bal_352.
en_353. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem.
bal_353.
en_354. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam.
bal_354.
en_355. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone.
bal_355.
en_356. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our friends who have been so kind!
bal_356.
en_357. I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.
bal_357.
en_358. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.

en_364. Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._
bal_364.
en_365. After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf department is included.
bal_365.
en_366. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him.
bal_366.
en_367. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable.
bal_367.
en_368. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business” until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied.
bal_368.
en_369. Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:-- “Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.
bal_369.
en_370. You’ll excoose me refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals.
bal_370.
en_371. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions.”
bal_371.
en_372. “How do you mean, ask them questions?”
bal_372.
en_373. I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.
bal_373.
en_374. “’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals.
bal_374.
en_375. I don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin’.
bal_375.
en_376. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles.

en_377. Here’s you a-comin’ and arskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d answer.
bal_377.
en_378. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions.

en_379. Without offence did I tell yer to go to ’ell?”
bal_379.
en_380. “You did.”
